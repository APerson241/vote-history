===[[Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/K6ka|K6ka]]===
'''Final (189/50/9). Closed as successful by WJBscribe at 20:37, 7 January 2017 (UTC)'''
==== Nomination ====
{{User|K6ka}}&nbsp;‚Äì It's [[Special:Diff/635550907|long overdue]] that I present to you '''k6ka''' for consideration for adminship. In many ways, k6ka reminds me of me: they're rather gnomish, focusing more on the maintenance side of the project and helping other users rather than writing articles directly. I first came across k6ka in 2014 when they began clerking at the [[Wikipedia:Changing username]] venues. I was [[Special:Diff/627581631|rather impressed]] with their diligent work there - they had a keen sense of the relevant policies, guidelines, and community norms, and excelled at helping users navigate the sometimes-confusing username change process. Accordingly, I [[Special:Diff/665177794|encouraged them]] to apply for the [[meta:Global renamer]] privilege when it became available to non-bureaucrat users in 2015. Since their successful candidacy, I've had the privilege of working alongside k6ka on the global rename queue, at [[meta:Steward requests/Username changes]], [[Wikipedia:Changing username/Simple]], as well as [[Wikipedia:Changing username/Usurpations]] (where they continue to clerk in advance of the much-awaited global usurpation policy). While k6ka does not have a large volume of content-writing contributions that can be presented for scrutiny, neither did I when I became an administrator many moons ago. And we need administrators who are willing to do the grunt-work of clearing backlogs, just as we need our article writers to focus on creating high-quality content for our readers. Accordingly, I strongly recommend granting k6ka the administrative toolset - I'm certain you will not be disappointed with their administrative work. ‚Äì[[User:xeno|<b style="font-family:verdana;color:#000">xeno</b>]][[user talk:xeno|<sup style="color:#000">talk</sup>]] 16:39, 27 December 2016 (UTC)

==== Co-nomination ====
xeno gave a great summary of K6ka's work in the renaming-department of Wikipedia. With a whopping 34,000 mainspace edits however, K6ka also does great work with counter-vandalism. First thing one notices when they go to k6ka's talk page are multiple notices that would help new editors, which are frequently attracted to vandal-fighters' talk pages. If you visit k6ka's [[User:K6ka/Subpages|subpages]], there are multiple ones that might attract a new user. One that catches the eye is [[User:K6ka/Becoming a vandal fighter]]. It is pretty much an unintended, extremely simplified version of [[User:Callanecc/CVUA/Tasks]]. With 3 years of activity, a clean blocklog, and exemplary responses in the archives, it is pretty clear that k6ka is civil. I am sure that k6ka would be a great contribution to the [[Wikipedia:Administrators|mop corps]].

====Questions for the candidate====
Dear candidate, thank you for offering to serve Wikipedia as an administrator. Please answer these questions to provide guidance for participants:
:'''1.''' What administrative work do you intend to take part in?
::'''A:''' I intend on focusing primarily on [[WP:AIV|AIV]], as my background on Wikipedia is largely comprised of vandal fighting. I have also reported a number of usernames to [[WP:UAA|UAA]], and my background in [[m:global renamer|global renaming]] will also come in handy there, as I can already process username change requests. I have tried out [[WP:NPP|New Pages Patrolling]], but very scantily, and I don't intend on working there anytime soon. I also don't have much interest in working at [[WP:AFD|AFD]]. I have had experience with the admin tools on Wikia, but Wikia and Wikipedia are two very different places, so expect me to be a bit careful with the tools within the first week of adminship. Of course, I'll ask for help during difficult situations.

::'''EDIT Jan 7 2017:''' It would seem that there is some misunderstanding about what I mean by {{tq|expect me to be a bit careful with the tools within the first week of adminship}}. To clarify, I am ''not'' saying "I'll be careful with the tools for the first week and then it's off for a demolition derby!" When I wrote that statement, the idea I originally had in mind is the sort of [[wikt:gingerliness|gingerliness]] practiced by someone when they are new to something. For example, take someone who is new to driving: they've just gotten into the driver's seat and their entire body is shaking with fear. Once one gets used to and comfortable with driving, however, the prospect of getting behind the wheel becomes much less daunting. The idea is the same here: as a new admin, I may be hesitant to use the tools initially, given the fact that I do not have experience with using them here; however, after using it for a bit, I'll be more comfortable with using them when needed. It ''does not'' mean that one isn't careful: a driver that is comfortable behind the wheel must still observe all of the rules on the road and must never drive carelessly; thus a Wikipedia administrator must still observe all of the policies and guidelines and must never brandish their tools wantonly. There are unique circumstances, however, where admins should again be gingerly when using their tools, such as a controversial ANI case that is difficult to resolve; this is much like getting into a car with a severe thunderstorm outside ‚Äî no matter how experienced the driver is, it is ''good'' for them to drive with infinite care. In both cases, it is often better to hold off on using the tools/driving the car, and to avoid basing actions on instinct rather than rational thought. Finally, "first week" is variable, and perhaps it should be more appropriately worded as "for as long as it takes for me to get used to the tools". As aforementioned, it does ''not'' mean that I will begin to use the tools recklessly once the timer is up, much like it does not mean that a driver is going to drive like a maniac once they are no longer paranoid of the driver's seat.
::Hopefully I've clarified some concerns, and I apologize for any confusion caused. ‚Äî[[User:K6ka|'''<span style="color:#0040FF">k6ka</span>''']] <span title="Canadian!" style="color:red">üçÅ</span> ([[User talk:K6ka|<span style="color:#0080FF">Talk</span>]] ¬∑ [[Special:Contributions/K6ka|<span style="color:#0B4C5F">Contributions</span>]]) 03:26, 7 January 2017 (UTC)

:'''2.''' What are your best contributions to Wikipedia, and why?
::'''A:''' Much on my work on Wikipedia has been fighting vandalism, and recently I have been very active on [[WP:CHUS]], processing requests there. Before I received global rename, I was a clerk there ‚Äî a ''non-admin clerk'', admittedly, but the job didn't require the admin bit, and it was really mostly about fixing malformed requests and notifying users about problematic requests.

::I will admit that I do not have much content creation tucked under my belt. Most of my non-maintenance edits on Wikipedia have been gnomish work, fixing typos, some copyediting here and there, adding a source, etc. Recently I've been working on [[Tribu (film)]], which isn't a particularly *exciting* article, but while it may not meet up to even GA standard, it still looks better than when I first found the article earlier this year.

:'''3.''' Have you been in any conflicts over editing in the past or have other users caused you stress? How have you dealt with it and how will you deal with it in the future?
::'''A:''' I've been fairly careful to avoid conflict on Wikipedia, though there have been some shoe scuffs here and there. The most significant of the conflicts I had been involved in took place at [[Talk:Street Artists Program of San Francisco]] about two years ago. I only made [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Street_Artists_Program_of_San_Francisco&diff=595896416&oldid=595896216 one edit] to the article in question; I noticed that a substantial part of the article was removed despite being sourced, so I reverted with an explanation. I tried to explain our policies to the editor that got reverted, but as I lacked interest in the subject of the article, I limited my participation on the talk page. There was a resulting edit war on the article, one that I did not partake in, and eventually the editor was blocked per [[WP:NOTHERE]]. It did help me familiarize myself with the [[WP:CONPOL|content policies]], and above all it was a very important reminder not to lose one's cool and to always [[WP:AGF|assume good faith]], especially if you're telling other editors to do the same. I don't recall too many times where I have been frustrated with an editor, and I'm willing to apologize for any cases where I have snapped, since that's never okay even if I was right.

::My only significant appearance on ANI can be found [[Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive818#K6ka|here]]. It was not a user conduct issue, but a technical one; a glitch in the MediaWiki software resulted in random users being notified about messages left on their talk page even when no such message existed. It just so happened that one of the warnings I (correctly) issued somehow gave an innocent user a notification, and the user got confused and thought something was up. The problem was already being discussed at the correct venues, and was fixed shortly after.

;Additional question from [[User:Linguist111|Linguist111]]
:'''4.''' You see the following usernames at UAA or in the [[Special:Log/newusers|new users log]]. None of the users have edited yet. What do you do?

*JulieLejeune&MelissaRusso
*K7ka
*SpeedyDelete201
*DonaldTrumpFan930
*Jim bo
*UndoEdits732
*IWannaBeAnAdminAndSPIClerk
::'''A:'''
::* '''JulieLejeune&MelissaRusso''': This username is clearly in violation of [[WP:ISU]], as it implies that the account is in use by two or more people. A quick Google search indicates that these two names are real people who are already deceased, so that would also be of something to note, especially if the user chooses to edit articles that are related to the subjects in their username. [[WP:UAAI]] states that {{tq|it is not sufficient to block an account for implied sharing alone}}, so the best course of action would be to tap the user on the shoulder and inform them about their username, and encourage them to change it.
::* '''K7ka''': A red flag for sure. I'm willing to err on the side of caution and wait for them to edit. If it's clear that they are attempting to impersonate me and are disrupting Wikipedia, I'll block immediately. If they aren't editing, it may be best to AGF and leave them a note advising them about the similarities between our usernames.
::* '''SpeedyDelete201''': May count as a [[WP:MISLEADNAME|misleading username]] as it {{tq|appear[s] similar to naming conventions used by community administrative processes}}. If they aren't editing disruptively I'd softblock and encourage them to change their username.
::* '''DonaldTrumpFan930''': Nothing inherently wrong with this username, but would monitor this user for any biased/promotional editing. Highly unlikely that they would be blocked for their username, however.
::* '''Jim bo''': May be an intentional reference to [[User:Jimbo Wales|Jimbo Wales]], and may also be perfectly innocent; their nickname (or real name) may be "Jimbo" or "Jim Bo" and there's nothing wrong with that. Would monitor for inappropriate edits, however.
::* '''UndoEdits732''': Much like "SpeedyDelete201", it may count as a misleading username and it may imply disruption as well. Again, if there aren't any disruptive edits, I'd softblock and encourage them to change their username.
::* '''IWannaBeAnAdminAndSPIClerk''': This username doesn't seem to be a clear-cut violation of WP:MISLEADNAME, as it makes it fairly clear that it isn't yet an admin or an SPI clerk. It does imply, however, that the person behind the username already has a knowledge of Wikipedia administrators and [[WP:SPI|sockpuppet investigations]]. I would not block immediately without sufficient evidence; it could be a troll, an actual sockpuppet, or a young, enthusiastic hat collector ‚Äî best case scenario is that it's nothing harmful at all. Would monitor their activity, and if a block is issued, it would be because of their actions; the username itself is not enough to warrant a block alone.

;Additional question from [[User:Beyond My Ken|Beyond My Ken]]
:'''5.''' In 2013 53% of your edits were to mainspace. In 2014, they fell to 47%, then 43% in 2015, and this year they are a little under 30%. Why is that?  What have you been been doing instead of editing the content of the encyclopedia?
::'''A:''' In 2013 I was still a fairly inexperienced editor, without much knowledge of the Project namespace; as such, I mostly edited mainspace articles. In 2014 and 2015, I focused heavily on vandalism-fighting and patrolling, which created a significant uptick in User talk and Project namespace edits. I did less patrolling in 2016, however, and primarily focused on working at [[WP:CHU]], hence the reduction in mainspace edits. ‚Äî[[User:K6ka|'''<span style="color:#0040FF">k6ka</span>''']] <span title="Canadian!" style="color:red">üçÅ</span> ([[User talk:K6ka|<span style="color:#0080FF">Talk</span>]] ¬∑ [[Special:Contributions/K6ka|<span style="color:#0B4C5F">Contributions</span>]]) 21:28, 31 December 2016 (UTC)

;Additional question from [[User:Ritchie333|Ritchie333]]
:'''6.''' A brand new user creates an article. Its text in full is "the target roundabout is in west london". What actions, if any, would you take towards this?
::'''A:''' The article should be left alone for at least ten to fifteen minutes to give the editor some time to expand on it. [[WP:A1|A1]] is not appropriate for this article as there is ''some'' context to help editors expand on it, and it is not eligible for [[WP:A3|A3]] as it isn't entirely devoid of content. At the very least parts of the article can be slightly rewritten (e.g. "<Name of roundabout>" is a roundabout in West London"), and a {{tlx|Road-stub}} tag can be added. While it may not be eligible for CSD, I may PROD it if I cannot find any reliable sources relating to the subject of the article. In all cases I would ask for a second opinion, though not "formally"; I may either ask an editor who is interested in road-related articles for advice, or I may bring it up on IRC for suggestions from other editors. ‚Äî[[User:K6ka|'''<span style="color:#0040FF">k6ka</span>''']] <span title="Canadian!" style="color:red">üçÅ</span> ([[User talk:K6ka|<span style="color:#0080FF">Talk</span>]] ¬∑ [[Special:Contributions/K6ka|<span style="color:#0B4C5F">Contributions</span>]]) 00:04, 1 January 2017 (UTC)
;Additional question from [[User:Ritchie333|Ritchie333]]
:'''7.''' An IP adds an infobox to [[John Le Mesurier]] with no edit summary. It is quickly reverted by an established editor known for creating multiple [[WP:FA|featured articles]] with an edit summary "rvv". A different IP, but clearly a dynamic one allocated to the same ISP, puts the infobox back in, again with no edit summary. The experienced editor reverts with a summary "rv tedious bullshit". The IP re-reverts the infobox with no edit summary again, and it is promptly reverted by the experienced editor with a summary "why don't you fuck off to facebook"; additionally the experienced editor adds {{tlx|uw-vandalism4}} to the IP's talk page. You are asked to take a look at the dispute; what actions would you take?
::'''A:''' The first course of action would be to notify the IP editor about the [[WP:3RR|three revert rule]], remind the experienced editor about the consequences for edit warring, and encourage the two to stop editing the article and discuss the changes (politely) on the article's talk page; a handwritten message should be used for the more experienced editor, to avoid [[WP:DTTR|templating them]]. The experienced editor should also be advised to mind their use of language and to avoid telling editors to "fuck off" as this, at the very least, construes [[WP:INCIVIL|incivility]] and makes consensus-building difficult. It should also be worth mentioning that their use of {{tlx|uw-vandalism4}} is grossly inappropriate as edit warring, while disruptive, is not considered to be vandalism, and it is also inappropriate to use considering the IP editor hasn't been issued lower-level warnings before. On the other hand, the IP editor should be advised to also stop edit warring and to discuss their changes on the talk page, and to seek towards achieving a new consensus through civil discussion or to respect existing ones. If the two users persist, I would prefer asking another administrator for a second opinion, ''especially'' if this was the first time I was attempting to resolve a potential edit war as an administrator. In all cases, it's best to avoid making any changes to the article that may aggravate the edit war, or would otherwise convince other editors that I was involved in the war. ‚Äî[[User:K6ka|'''<span style="color:#0040FF">k6ka</span>''']] <span title="Canadian!" style="color:red">üçÅ</span> ([[User talk:K6ka|<span style="color:#0080FF">Talk</span>]] ¬∑ [[Special:Contributions/K6ka|<span style="color:#0B4C5F">Contributions</span>]]) 00:04, 1 January 2017 (UTC)

:'''10.''' You haven't interacted with AfD much, something that many feel is necessary for an admin. How would this change if you were made an admin? Would you feel comfortable closing an AfD?
::'''A:''' I am aware of the opposes for my lack of AFD participation, and I am not undermining the importance of AFD; it ''is'' a place that needs administrators to keep it humming along smoothly. I have generally avoided AFD due to my lack of interest in that part of Wikipedia, and it's clear that this has caught up with me. I can't say that this will change drastically if this RFA succeeds, but whether I get the mop or not, if I do wish to get involved in AFD, it is important that I remove my administrator hat (If I have one) and put on my editor hat, and participate at AFD as an editor. Only after participating in a sizable number of AFDs ("Sizable" does not mean "Three AFDs and I'm a whiz!"), attaining sufficient experience of the process to know how it's done and what is expected (Content creation helps with this, as many have told me), and having consulted with different editors about my performance will I be comfortable closing an AFD. Lastly, as [[Wikipedia:Administrators]] states in its lede: {{tq|[Administrators] are never required to use their tools}}, and if there is an AFD that I am genuinely uncomfortable in closing, it may be better to either take off the admin hat and participate as an editor in order to work towards a clearer consensus, or to leave it for another admin to handle. ‚Äî[[User:K6ka|'''<span style="color:#0040FF">k6ka</span>''']] <span title="Canadian!" style="color:red">üçÅ</span> ([[User talk:K6ka|<span style="color:#0080FF">Talk</span>]] ¬∑ [[Special:Contributions/K6ka|<span style="color:#0B4C5F">Contributions</span>]]) 16:26, 4 January 2017 (UTC)

You haven't interacted with AfD much, but I figure that we can gauge your experience by seeing how you'd close these AfDs.

*[[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Brent Watkins]]

This one is optional since honestly, it'd make most anyone run for the hills and would take a very seasoned admin to close, my thought is that if you can break this one down then honestly, you can close just about any AfD with ease.

#'''Support''' I started to write a nomination statement for K6ka over a year ago, but never finished it or presented it to him. Now I won't get the credit as a nominator :( but that's OK, just glad to see this happening! On the counter-vandalism front, K6ka is easily one of the best in the fleet. It only makes sense to give them the block and protect buttons. I can count on two hands instances they've resorted to pinging admins on IRC to protect a page due to rapid influx of vandalism, when the [[WP:RFPP]] request had gone unanswered for some time. Clear case of they need the tools, but don't have them, and the project consequently suffers. That's a net-positive, but I think they'll far exceed even that classification. Sure, content creation is important, but the bulk of adminship is about preventing abuse, and that's something K6ka excels at <span style="font-family:sans-serif">&mdash; <span style="font-weight:bold">[[User:MusikAnimal|<span style="color:black; font-style:italic">MusikAnimal</span>]] <sup>[[User talk:MusikAnimal|<span style="color:green">talk</span>]]</sup></span></span> 21:34, 31 December 2016 (UTC)

#::On a tangent to {{U|Ritchie333}}'s comment, according to [[Wikipedia:Systemic bias]], the "average Wikipedian" is between ages 15 through 49.

#:::I almost never add a comment among the !votes but here I thought I would post agreement with [[User:Ritchie333|<b style="color:#7F007F">Ritchie333</b>]]'s comment about maturity. I think that especially young administrator candidates do need to definitely prove themselves before being favorably considered here. I was aware of K6ka's age when I placed my support so I think he qualifies in regard to maturity and having proved himself. I am glad to see [[User:Kudpung|Kudpung ‡∏Å‡∏∏‡∏î‡∏ú‡∏∂‡πâ‡∏á]]'s comments in support along these lines. Also, FWIW, the surveys concerning the average age of Wikipedians are from 2005 if I read the paragraphs about them correctly. Even if valid then, there has been plenty of turnover in users since then. The surveys, even if a valid picture of the age distribution in 2005, may not tell much about the current age distribution of regular contributors. It certainly does not exclude the fact that there are some number, perhaps many, older contributors. It seems to me that most current users do not disclose their age so no valid estimate of age distribution could be made from the ages of those that do. In addition to knowing the age of those whose ages are disclosed, I do think that occasionally one can make a good guess about a user's age. Again, that may only be relevant if there is a demonstration or suspicion of immaturity or inexperience. [[User:Donner60|Donner60]] ([[User talk:Donner60|talk]]) 04:46, 7 January 2017 (UTC)
#::::From the limited evidence of Wikimeetup/Wikimania photos and those who do identify their age or stage of life and the types of discussions that take place here, the vibe I get is that the average Wikipedian has aged significantly from 2005 to 2017. Many prolific school or college student editors from 12 years ago have full-time jobs, are at an important stage in their careers, have become or are already parents with further responsibilities and are therefore, no longer as active. Meanwhile, the increasingly retired baby boomers are more computer literate than their counterparts in 2005, and with a rise in spare time edit much more here. <font color="teal">[[User:DaGizza|Gizza]]</font> <sup><font color="teal">([[User_talk:DaGizza|t]])([[Special:Contributions/DaGizza|c]])</font></sup> 07:01, 7 January 2017 (UTC)
#:::::There was an editor survey circa 2009/10 since then we know the community has aged - you only have to consider the hundreds of still active admins who are now six years older than they were six years ago to prove that. The issue we can't be sure of is whether we are only aging a year per year or whether the combination of the rise of the silver surfers and the loss of the latest generation of screenagers to smartphones means "the greying of the pedia" we are aging by more than a year per year.

#'''Support'''. The opposers make some sense. It's perfectly reasonable to expect that somebody 'gets' what we're doing here and has demonstrated at least basic editing skills. We need our administrators to be able to tell the difference between vandalism and constructive edits, between reliable and unreliable sources, between neutral editing and POV pushing; and we need them to be able to respond appropriately. But I believe K6ka has demonstrated those abilities through seven years of editing. I was on the fence at first, but the answer Q8 swung me firmly into the support column: the edits to Maya society, Maya script, and Maya numerals show that he is willing and able to do some research and find a reliable source for something rather than robotically tagging and moving on. That's enough for me. It's true that that is the primary purpose of Wikipedia whereas K6ka tends to focus on secondary activities, but we're all volunteers and we focus on what we're interested in, and nobody sensibly doubts that maintenance and vandal-fighting need to be done.

#'''Support'''. I've had to think hard about this one, but I'm ending up supporting pretty much per HJ Mitchell. On the one hand, I see no problem with what the candidate says on their user page about content creators and admins. I'm definitely not a stickler for content creation, but I think that quite a few oppose comments are valid to the extent that there really is awfully little experience in content matters. (The diffs about giving incorrect advice to new editors are pretty old, from 2014.) I looked at the ANI thread linked in the answer to Q3, and had a moment of cognitive dissonance over all those links dated later in 2017, but I would have been happier if the candidate had been a little more communicative about feeling bad about the glitch. So I've wondered if this is someone who lacks the communication skills that admins need, and also lacks enough experience in content disputes beyond just vandalism reverts. So my advice is to not overreach, just focus on using the tools in the spirit of "mopping" rather than mediating or enforcing complex disputes. And that said, I trust the noms enough to believe that there won't be overreach, and I see this as a net positive. --[[User:Tryptofish|Tryptofish]] ([[User talk:Tryptofish|talk]]) 00:22, 3 January 2017 (UTC)

#'''Support'''. As {{U|Ritchie333}} states in  his oppose: {{green|‚Äô‚Äôteenagers high-fiving each other with vandalism barnstars ‚Äò‚Äô}} happened to be also the reason  the [[WP:CVUA]] was closed down a few years ago  and re-started again  from scratch, so I do have a certain foreboding of people who started their  Wiki career before they  were old enough  to  wear long  trousers. Fortunately this not the case here and K6ka obviously does not appear to have been working towards adminship, but oddly that brings me to the essence of my concern: mainly, but mot only, the lack of article creation. There are a few valid points in the oppose section coming from people I enjoy working with, while other comments there I take with a pinch of salt. Failing widely to meet my [[user:Kudpung/RfA criteria|criteria]] largely because some of the items the list are conditional on others (conundrum: you can‚Äôt be classed as a bad driver if you‚Äôve never driven a car and don't know the difference between a clutch pedal and a rear view mirror), I could nevertheless not come up with the kind of flimsy cause to oppose as one of our regular oppose voters is wont to do. I therefore put my trust in {{U|Xeno}} whose opinions I trust and respect, and {{U|HJ Mitchell}} (who  also  ought  to  be a 'crat by now) who makes the most valid statement, in the knowledge that K6ka is almost certainly going to be a net positive and will probably not find himself at the centre of too much drama in horrible places such as ANI.

I would strongly advise the candidate to seriously get some content creation under their belt. There are many prolific content creators who are also admins. It is not necessarily an "and/or" situation. This was quite the most difficult of the rich crop of RfA's to !vote on. Oddly, this unprecedented glut of serious RfA's both in quality and number has also made the !voting community step up a gear, and I am seeing far more well-reasoned debate, and a lack of nasty crap.

He has a solid record of good work in renaming (where there really are consequences for screwups, unlike many admin errors!) and his intended areas of focus with the tools use similar skillsets. We have plenty of gnomish admins who don't have the "wikicop" mentality Iridescent describes (and which I agree is a problem), and I don't see enough evidence here that k6ka is an unusual risk for developing that problem. I'd certainly encourage him to steer clear of blocking established editors or getting too involved in "civility enforcement", but then, I'd encourage all admins to do that.

#'''Support''' because opposes which are ''solely'' due to lack of article creation are entirely unconvincing. Adminship is not a reward for writing new content, it's a janitorial duty that someone has to do to keep the place clean so the so-called content creators can be off doing their content creation thing without being mired in vandals and sockpuppets and POV warriors and blatant spam and pages that need to be moved and discussions that never get closed and whatever other clean-up tasks get in the way. k6ka's behind-the-scenes non-content contributions are stellar, and that's what we ought to be talking about. I get that there's an expectation that admins should ''understand'' content creation, but I haven't seen anyone here come up with any kind of good reason to suspect that k6ka does not. His one mentioned substantial contribution took [[Tribu (film)]] from looking like [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tribu_(film)&oldid=693989583 this] to looking like [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tribu_(film)&oldid=758186379 this] over a fairly concentrated and extended period of time. Yeah, it's not terribly special, but it's just fine for what it is, and it's good enough to show he knows how to lay out an article and fix problems.

#'''Support''' (moved from Neutral). Having taken the time to read what has happened since I voted, I am moving here for two reasons. First, K6ka has just over three years of active editing experience with no major controversies (I am not counting the time before October/November 2013). While he may not have demonstrated article experience, I think he has been around long enough to have picked up on how these areas work and how to properly assess the need for administrative action in those areas. Why I think that leads me to my second reason. He has expressed self-awareness about his strengths, weaknesses, and willingness to listen to the community as shown in the answers to Q11, Q12, and taking the time to consider Oshwah‚Äôs complex questions [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/K6ka&diff=prev&oldid=758522207 as seen in this edit].

#A clueful and experienced candidate. Re the Oppose arguments, the Teahouse related edits from 2014 may demonstrate that the candidate wasn't ready in 2014, and might have been relevant in early 2015. It is 2017, to convince people that a candidate is inexperienced now you need edits from a lot less than two years ago (fine to go back two years for examples of badfaith editing as that is less subject to change, inexperience tends to be resolved by experience). Content contributions seem thin and the community is divided as to how much one needs - with the addition of the answer to my question the candidate meets my criteria and even cites things to real books. I believe he meets the criteria of a large majority here, but I'd emphasise to him and to future candidates watching the need to demonstrate that you can add reliable sources to Wikipedia. Ideally in your answer to q2. Others oppose because the candidate has never started a new article. I'm usually reckoned one of the more inclusionist wikipedians, but even as a member of the Article Rescue Squadron I think that is going too far. I'm just as happy with RFA candidates who rescue or work on articles others have started. I don't think that starting new articles is an essential experience for an admin.

I honestly think it's mostly asked for here for political reasons (the Wikipedia equivalent of [[The price of milk|expecting someone to know the price of milk]]). Lack of AfD experience would be a problem if the candidate was intending to work at AfD, but they aren't and they have the necessary judgement to stay away until they have more experience.

#'''Support'''; candidate looks like he'll be a benefit, and last time I checked, there wasn't a policy requiring extensive content creation for new admins.  I see no reason to expect that the tools will be abused, and since we don't have a limit on the number of admins, adding another will be helpful.  And as someone who's faced the possibility of [[User:Hawkeye7|Hawkeye7]]'s hypothetical situation (it ended up not happening, but [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&type=rights&user=&page=User%3ANyttend&year=&month=-1&tagfilter=&subtype= I requested de-admin] in February 2015 so I couldn't be forced to do something), I'd encourage you to think how you'd respond if real-life pressure came.

#:Hawkeye7's question was about which policies and guidelines apply in such a case, not how the candidate would react. Afaik there is not a single page which gives advice to admins on what to do when the police comes knocking IRL, is there? (if there isn't, someone should really create one) And seeing how most people confronted with police asking them to do something are more than willing to comply without questioning their right to ask it (speaking from professional experience as a lawyer who has far too often seen a client happily confess everything to the police and ''then'' seek legal counsel), I don't think there is any "right" answer to the question you pose. It really depends on the circumstances, the country the candidate lives in, their personal background handling such requests from official sources etc. But if there is no right or wrong answer, the answer to the question might be interesting in a philosophical way but also skew the results of an RfA without the candidate being able to avoid it and thus should be avoided.

#'''Support'''. I generally look for bad things candidates have done before I compose a rationale opposing them. Most on the opposition side of this are criticizing the candidate for what they have not done, and I find the few criticisms for actions in the candidate's core competency areas (vandalism patrol and user names) totally unpersuasive. My routine patrol of the noticeboards for questionable behavior came up empty. Answers to questions above are satisfactory. I trust that K6ka will not step on the toes of content creators. As long as Wikipedia is an encyclopedia "anyone can edit" we'll need contributors like this, and I'm grateful we have them. I'm giving K6ka a pass on content-creation because they are an 18 year-old student, and hoping that by the time they've graduated they will have developed a bit more academic research and writing skills, such that they may contribute more in that area in the future.

#'''Support''' I fully endorse the idea expressed by numerous editors below that administrators should have significant content creation experience, and I hope that's something that potential nominators and nominees take on-board for future RfAs - do some article work - get some DYKs, maybe a GA or two, perhaps populate a featured list or two, that sort of thing, before running. It's essential that candidates have a good grasp on sources, can write in a neutral one and can understand concerns expressed by those who focus extensively on writing, something that is virtually impossible to determine without significant mainspace contributions. The only reason I'm supporting is because I've chatted with K6ka online and I've been able to satisfy myself personally that they can be trusted with the toolset. If I wasn't satisfied I would be very firmly opposing. [[User:Nick|Nick]] ([[User talk:Nick|talk]]) 18:44, 7 January 2017 (UTC)

Gilliam seems to grant such permissions frequently to recent changes patrollers.  This doesn't seem to relate to activity on site such as [[WP:PERM]] so I suppose that related communication happens in some other forum such as IRC.  Another user who was granted autopatrolled rights in a similar way at that time was [[User:Helpsome|Helpsome]].  They had actually created some articles though not as many as the [[WP:APAT|suggested standard of 25]].  They all seem to be about buddhism and the first example is [[Tsadra Foundation]].  This seems somewhat promotional in tone and so my impression is that the granting of autopatrolled status was premature.  But admins can grant such permissions at their discretion.

#'''Oppose''' - per Andrew's !vote and also the user gives an impression that they're here only for the administrative tools and not for constructive editing such as improving an article by adding content. Most of their edits are merely revertions and undos of other editors' edits. I also think that the user fail to distinguish between what seems wrong and what is actually wrong. For example, the username K7ka seems to be impersonating K6ka. It seems wrong but it isn't because it's just a username that could be coincidentally the same as K6ka's without any malicious intentions. The proper response to that should be to leave it alone and judge their impersonation by editing skills. I feel that the user should demonstrate a desire to help Wikipedia by contributing content and not just by reverting vandalism before getting the admin rights. - <font style="padding:1px 2px;background:#ADE6E1;border:1px solid"><font color="black">'''The'''</font></font><font style="padding:1px 5px;background:black;">[[user talk:TheMagnificentist|<font color="ADE6E1">Magnificentist</font>]]</font> 12:05, 1 January 2017 (UTC)

If it's clear that they are attempting to impersonate me and are disrupting Wikipedia, I'll block immediately}}. Administrators are frequently targeted by trolls who try to impersonate them or who create derogatory derivatives of their usernames, nothing K6ka has said deviates at all from commonly accepted norms in dealing with impersonation or trolling. [[User:Nick|Nick]] ([[User talk:Nick|talk]]) 12:50, 1 January 2017 (UTC)
#::It would be improper to block in such a case.  Per [[WP:TOOLMISUSE]], "Administrators should not normally use their tools in matters in which they are personally involved".

#:::We've never considered blocking obvious impersonation accounts or trolling accounts to have any level of 'personal involvement' and as far back as I can remember, I can recall no administrator being sanctioned for doing so, hence K6ka's answer being in line with commonly accepted norms.

#:::{{ec}}TOOLMISUSE says the following on the subject "Administrators should not '''''normally''''' use their tools in matters in which they are personally involved (for example, in a content dispute in which they are a party). See [[WP:INVOLVED|Involved admins]]" (emphasises added). The use of "normally" implies that there are circumstances in which such tool usage is acceptable. WP:INVOLVED further clarifies that "in straightforward cases (e.g., blatant vandalism), the community has historically endorsed the obvious action of any administrator ‚Äì even if involved ‚Äì on the basis that any reasonable administrator would have probably come to the same conclusion." I consider username impersonation to be a serious form of vandalism because it poses a serious threat of disruption. Therefore, I disagree with your interpretation of policy here.

#:::: It is quite normal for usernames to be similar because there are many millions of user accounts while the possibilities are limited.

As people can be quite possessive about such short names, it would be quite improper for an admin to act in their own interest in such a case.  I grant that they may often get away with such action as the sanctions for tool abuse are weakly enforced but that doesn't make it right.  At RfA, a candidate should indicate that they have a good appreciation of [[WP:INVOLVED]] and not casually expect to get away with such infractions.

#'''Oppose''' k6ka is certainly a valuable member of the Wikipedia community.  However, to be a good administrator requires having some experience with making and evaluating content. k6ka has created no articles nor substantially edited any article that I can find.  For example, k6ka has edited [[Reflection (Fifth Harmony album)]] 84 times, the most of any article, but they are all vandalism reverts.  k6ka has virtually no experience in AfD.  Thus, contrary to the first nominating statement above, k6ka is not [[WP:GNOME|a content gnome]].

#'''Oppose'''. Extreme dearth of content edits. I'm not talking about new article creation, I'm talking about content edits, period. The only content editing I see is on [[Tribu (film)]], the article the candidate cites in the Q&A, and those content edits were all done in the past two weeks [https://tools.wmflabs.org/sigma/usersearch.py?name=K6ka&page=Tribu_%28film%29&server=enwiki&max=], as if for show for this RfA. All other edits across article-space seem to be reversions. There's also a dearth of article talk-page edits, and no participation in dispute resolution (such as ANI or RfCs, etc.). Between the extreme dearth of content edits and AfD participation, and 55,000 automated or semi-automated edits, I just don't feel comfortable giving this candidate the tools. The thing is, nearly every single RfA candidate says they want to work in anti-vandalism, so that's not something we need, as there are many admins and non-admins already working in that area. And the tools are not given out piecemeal. We need admins who have edited content and discussed content policies and guidelines. And admins who know how to resolve conflicts. The fact that the candidate has an admitted aversion to NPP and AfD says to me they are not ready to be given the tools, because we don't give out the tools piecemeal. I thank the candidate for their counter-vandalism work, keep up the good work there, but I do not see a sufficient qualification for, or even need for, the tools. [[User:Softlavender|Softlavender]] ([[User talk:Softlavender|talk]]) 14:58, 2 January 2017 (UTC)<p>''Edited to add'': I just now reviewed the candidate's Teahouse responses and find him ignorant of the processes of article creation and submission, to the point of giving incorrect advice.

My personal advice to this candidate is to spend the next 6 months or so focusing heavily on content-editing and creation (including creating and fully citing at least one full-sized article), participating strongly at AfD, and engaging in some dispute-resolution assistance (e.g. at ANI, [[WP:DR]], [[WP:RfC]]s [for the latter can sign up at [[WP:FR]] to be notified], etc.), and possibly also assisting with NPP, and then come back and reapply for adminship.

(In my defence I at least got a third opinion on the talk page and partially self-reverted as a result) The problem then, as Iridescent says, is when non-content creating admins swoop in on high and dish out [[WP:CIVIL]] / [[WP:NPA]] sanctions seemingly without any idea what the root cause is, or whether it's actually going to be a net improvement to the project.

#:::::Thing about all this is that according to policy we're ''still'' not supposed to be frustrated. We have lots of policies specifically dealing with what to do if someone makes a change to an article we don't agree with! If we believe in these policies we should also apply them. If someone says "for fuck's sake, I just spent $100 on sources..." a civility block is way too soon, but if that same someone violates 3RR for the same reason I would support a block (and I suspect you will too, since it's policy). I don't want to say much about TRM vs. Mike V, but again in that situation there were policies laid out on what to do. Simply following the policies would've resulted in the same result with less vitriol all around. I see already too many disputes which could've been resolved if everyone just dropped the stick and did something else; I certainly don't see it as a positive to appoint more administrators who are happy to tolerate such behavior.<p>
#:::::@Ritchie333 I can't agree with that, because "we are all human" is not an excuse to violate policy. Even in real life this can at best only be argued as a mitigating factor. As for violating WP:CIVIL and WP:NPA, the judgement of an uninvolved administrator is to be trusted - that's why we have WP:INVOLVED right? And as long as we're citing examples, here's one I was involved in not so long ago: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:List_of_world_records_in_chess#Consecutive_wins_record]. Like in your example, an anonymous / new editor pops up to add information to an article that may not have been an improvement. This edit was soon vigorously opposed by several different editors and removed. But if you compare the two discussions, there was almost no conduct dispute in the chess article, no need for administrator intervention, and the dispute was resolved amiably. That should be the kind of ideal we strive for - getting frustrated is not good, even if it is human and even if it is justified. I'm sorry but I cannot agree with this reason to oppose.

For one thing, I respect the nominator, xeno, a great deal, and therefore would very much like to support, but I'm not really happy with (nor did I completely understand) the nom's answer to my question. On the other hand, Meta thought enough of the editor to make them a global renamer, but on the other hand, I'm philosophically opposed to the usurpation of what were prerogatives of individual Wikipedias by Meta, nor do I think that the participation there is at a level that their decisions about functionaries can automatically be taken as a recommendation. Content work also seems to be lacking - " fixing typos, some copyediting here and there, adding a source" is all fine, I do the same, but I'm looking for '''''real''''' content work, i.e. creating non-stub articles, greatly expanding articles, taking a badly written or structured article and revamping it into a good, informative, well-written article.  It's only by doing work like this that a would-be admin can understand the needs of content editors, which is '''''vital''''' to the reputation of the encyclopedia. As a result, I'm sitting here at oppose (sitting at neutral is just silly, and I rarely do that) unless and until I see further information to change my mind.

#:[[User:Beyond My Ken]], I'm a little confused on how renaming a global account across all wikis is a prerogative of individual Wikipedias. Could you clarify that? If you just oppose SUL entirely, that train left the station a long time ago, and I'm not sure this is the place to voice your concerns. Also, in Mike's RfA, you opposed because his editing percentages were 46% Main, 47% user talk. Here, it seems that you oppose because the editing percentages are 43%, 43%. We can agree to disagree on the content creation issue, but what are your required pie chart percentage ranges to support?

#::I see no conflict between the two opposes.  If 46% main is too low, then 43% is too low as well.  I have no hard-and-fast line, each nominee is evaluated based on their total package.  I believe in one recent "support" I said that I wasn't happy with the editor's article percentage, but, given other factors, I was supporting their nomination.

#'''Oppose'''.  We need all kinds of editors and administrators on Wikipedia.  I believe that K6ka takes a reasonable stance when it comes to content creation versus adminship, and his sentiments, including the quote from HighInBC, are hardly the polemical, divisive stands others make them out to be.   While I am no fan of the self-congratulatory dick waving from the self-styled content creators, I expect an administrator to have a minimal amount of experience with article writing and creation.   This editor otherwise appears to be an ideal candidate, so [[Wikipedia:Requested articles|write a couple of new articles]] and I'll be glad to vote support next time.

#'''Oppose''' per [[WP:NOTYET]] Admin tools are for content creators. Every admin is expected to be able to write articles. [[User:Hawkeye7|Hawkeye7]] ([[User talk:Hawkeye7|talk]]) 01:35, 3 January 2017 (UTC)
#:I would like to state why I think the answer to Q7 is inadequate. When someone presents themself as a vandal fighter, I expect to see understanding of that role, and this question tests this. The first thing is that the three-revert rule may not apply in this case. You should have considered exceptions to this rule. You mention consensus building, but when you looked at the article in question you found a comment that clearly states "A consensus exists not to have an infobox ‚Äì see [[Talk:John Le Mesurier/Archive 5#Infobox]] (from 2012) and [[Talk:John_Le_Mesurier#Infobox]] (from 2014 & 15) ‚Äì please do not put an infobox without seeking to change that consensus on the talk page". Thus, the editor in question has wilfully gone headlong against an established consensus that has already been built, not to mention the ArbCom INFOBOXES case, which you ''should'' have familiarised yourself with. An admin ''should'' attempt to uphold and enforce existing consensus. A passing admin ''could'' have blocked the offending editor forthwith. Or could have locked the page, which would be appropriate for a page under attack from multiple IPs. Did you consider the pros and cons of such alternatives? Or the irony of telling someone to respect existing consensus? You state that "that their use of {{tl|uw-vandalism4}} is grossly inappropriate as edit warring, while disruptive, is not considered to be vandalism". This begs certain questions, including: What is considered to be vandalism? What are the actual policies on what constitutes  vandalism? If an article contains an explicit instruction to not change something, say the spelling of a word, would deliberately doing so be construed as vandalism? What would be a more appropriate warning template? You said that the "IP editor hasn't been issued lower-level warnings before". That's incorrect; the IP ''address''hasn't been issued a lower-level warning. Are there warnings on other pages? Is a sock puppet investigation in order? And is there a requirement for the whole series of lower-level warnings to be issued, or can you jump straight to level 2, 3 or 4? Or, for that matter, straight to a block? I do not get the impression from the answer that all aspects of the issue are being considered. [[User:Hawkeye7|Hawkeye7]] ([[User talk:Hawkeye7|talk]]) 23:06, 6 January 2017 (UTC)

#'''Oppose''' - It's not at all fair to expect every admin to have created thousand of articles or have scores of FAs under their belt, but I think it is fair to expect ''some'' substantial experience, because that's where all the reports, noticeboards, nominations and all the other minutiae of the project comes from. You're not expected to be an expert at absolutely everything, but you are expected to be a well-rounded experienced editor, and that is a ''huge chunk'' of what being that means. Further, some of the answers posted above at the Teahouse show that lack of experience is reflected in overall understanding of areas that admin's shouldn't need explained to them. I would definitely encourage to come back in six months or a year if this is unsuccessful, and to spend that time getting gut deep into some content. Along the way, you should also consider that "expect me to be a bit careful with the tools within the first week of adminship" is, in my opinion, not at all an appropriately level-headed and humble approach to have.

#'''Oppose'''. The candidate has shown wonderful dedication to the project and has gazillions of edits. Neither has the candidate committed a huge faux pas. Although I appreciate vandal fighting, it is not an activity that requires the admin skills I want to see. I want administrators to show they can understand and apply policy. The vandal fighter also doesn't have to interact with difficult people. Revert the vandal a few times; if he persists, then have him blocked. OK, it's not always clear cut (Cluebot cannot do it all), but it's typically not the same challenge as CSD calls or AfD debates or a content dispute. A career arc that has some significant content contributions provides more exposure to policy and conflict. I have a lot of trouble with Q1&ndash;3. Q1 has poor focus. He says what he plans to do, but then spends a lot of time saying what he won't do. He talks about having admin privs on Wikia; this is not Wikia, and now I wonder about hat collecting across the Internet. He's tells us he knows how to be an admin (at Wikia). More concerning is the "expect me to be a bit careful with the tools within the first week of adminship". I want admins to be reserved, and I want the candidate being "careful with the tools" all the time &mdash; not just within the first week of adminship. Forgive me, but I read what people say and how they say it. An old boss taught me to read everything twice: once for what it says, and once for what it doesn't say. Q2 appropriately claims vandal fighting and admits little content creation. Content is an issue for me. I'm troubled by the comment that Tribu may not be GA remark because it's a touch dismissive. Furthermore, the first sentence at Tribu fails for grammar. Conflict question Q3 gives pure vandal fighters trouble; reverting vandalism is not reverting a well-intentioned editor's hour's worth of work; the vandal won't complain but the editor might. Swatting a vandal carries little risk of backlash. The conflict example that involves a single revert fails to understand the question's audience. Not only is there no conflict experience, but I'm also leery of candidates who are unwilling to engage. I don't want an aggressive stance or eagerness to engage, but I want admins who will be comfortable in difficult situations. The ANI example does not seem to be a stresser. I would have appreciated links where the candidate "snapped". I want to see practical experience with conflict rather than academic musings. Q6's ten to fifteen minutes is on the right track, but why the rush? I copied [[Francis Bashforth|an article from the de.WP]] and started translating it &mdash; a task that took me 18 minutes; of course, the article was CSD'd at the 7 minute mark. There are some other issues. I don't see you following the ORCP advice. Despite Beeblebrox'x comment, the autopatrolled issue goes beyond an improvident grant; I expect the candidate asked for right, and that implies a misunderstanding by the candidate. I don't think the candidate is bad, but I want to see experience with policy and conflict. Consequently, vandal fighters without significant content experience give me trouble as a class. Some other issues gnaw at me. [[User:Glrx|Glrx]] ([[User talk:Glrx|talk]]) 21:45, 3 January 2017 (UTC)

#'''Oppose''' (moved from support). Sadly, I'm ending up here. The lack of content creation isn't a huge concern of mine, but the more I think about it, the more I worry that it demonstrates lack of judgement to go for RfA with ''zero'' substantial content creation against the advice of many administrators and RfA regulars, myself included. That's relatively minor, though. The thing that forces me into the oppose section is the RFPP link from Amanda above. That article so obviously doesn't need semi-protection that I seriously worry that the candidate requested it in the first place as recently as October. With only two IPs on the article in a very tight range, there's just no need to prevent ''all'' non-confirmed editors from editing the page. Content creation would have allayed some of my concerns here, but at the end of the day, I care most about how well-polished the candidate is in the areas they want to work. The link Amanda provided calls that polish into question, and I found a few further concerns upon some digging. For example, reporting a username ([https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Usernames_for_administrator_attention&diff=prev&oldid=757956815 POOOOOOOOOOOOOO]) which is not an obvious violation of the username policy. ~ [[User:BU Rob13|<b>Rob</b><small><sub>13</sub></small>]]<sup style="margin-left:-1.0ex;">[[User talk:BU Rob13|Talk]]</sup> 01:30, 5 January 2017 (UTC)
#:Seems a little subjective to me ‚Äì POOOOOOOOOOOOOO can be interpreted as offensive (and was indeed interpreted as such by another administrator), but if you do not see why it's offensive it's not likely to offend you either. Reminds me of the time someone I know used the name "Suka" for a while (off-wiki) before the wrath of the administrators dropped on the name, because "Suka" is an offensive word in Polish.

#'''Oppose''', regretfully. My bar for content creation is pretty low, but looking through [https://tools.wmflabs.org/xtools/topedits/?lang=en&wiki=wikipedia&user=K6ka&namespace=0 this page], the candidate has no signficant content creation in their most-edited pages (i.e. any page with 7 or more edits) except for Tribu, and some of the sourcing there is sub-optimal. The rest of the edits to pages listed there, bar one or two exceptions (i.e. the TTC edit above) are reverts, filling in bare refs with tools, tagging, and occasionally some minor edits that didn't add much content. ''As far as I can tell, the candidate has next to zero content contributions aside from Tribu, which was only significantly contributed to last month.'' This is not a call for FAs or GAs from the candidate. Even a handful of pages with similar levels of content contributed by the candidate as shown in Tribut would be good enough for me.

#'''Oppose'''. I know it's a position that gets attacked in some quarters, but on reflection I am in the camp where I believe some level of content creation is a must for adminship. See [[WP:PILLARS#WP:5P1]]. "Wikipedia is an encyclopedia". That means we write articles. Of course, for some people their bread and butter is to hunt down vandalism, block vandals, perform deletions, close discussions, all that stuff. I thoroughly commend those people, it is a great thing, and essential, to have people working on those things round the clock. But like a manager who doesn't understand the thing that the people they're managing are doing, an admin without experience of content creation will always be one step removed from understanding the real issues underpinning what goes on here. My advice: go and write some articles, hunt down sources, get into it, destub some things - it's all great fun in its own right - and then come back here in a few months.

It's obvious that K6ka can write, so I would gladly reconsider his future bid for adminship after he has created a few non-stub article, made some article edits that require researching sources and discussing edits on article talk pages.- [[user: MrX|Mr]][[user talk:MrX|X]] 13:22, 7 January 2017 (UTC)

=====Neutral=====
#'''Neutral''' for now and with regret. While I don't see any red flags and they have an impressive record in the fields they have worked in, there are some gaps in areas I expect to see in a candidate's resume., Of particular concern is the dearth of content creation and AfD participation. In an otherwise highly qualified candidate I might be able to overlook one of these, but combined the two leave a big hole in [[User:Ad Orientem/So you want to be an Admin?|my RfA check list]]. At the moment I'm not seeing anything that would cause me to outright oppose the RfA, but neither can I pull the support trigger. -[[User:Ad Orientem|Ad Orientem]] ([[User talk:Ad Orientem|talk]]) 19:23, 1 January 2017 (UTC)

#:<s>Neutral.</s> '''Moved to support.''' While I don‚Äôt think a large amount of content work is needed as an administrator, the amount with this candidate is so low that I cannot vote to support. Wikipedia is an encyclopedia after all, and if a user wants to seriously contribute here, in any role, I think their contributions should reflect a greater understanding of this. Xeno may have been able to become an administrator with little content work many moons ago, but Wikipedia has changed quite a bit since then. That said, while I agree with the oppose views regarding the lack of content work, the nomination statements and answers to questions are strong and reflect a willingness to work in specific areas of familiarity. K6ka becoming an administrator will not cause Wikipedia to go down in flames. [[User:ZettaComposer|ZettaComposer]] ([[User talk:ZettaComposer|talk]]) 01:12, 2 January 2017 (UTC)
#'''Neutral''': As a content creator with close to 1000 articles, there is this extreme attachment I have to my articles that I believe all article creators should also have (maybe not as extreme like mine though).

#'''Neutral''' I was sitting at "weak support" (as on the balance of things I think that K6ka was going to be a net positive) but having the quote by HighinBC on their userpage (which is divisive and shows a lack of understanding of processes) is a real problem for me.

#:<s>Neutral</s> '''Moved to oppose.''' I see some good answers, better perhaps in at least some areas than other recently passed candidates. OTOH, I was honestly a bit horrified that the user expects to be careful with the tools for the first week. Having been around for a while, I continue to learn about new ways of being careful on at least a weekly basis, so the answer strikes me as a bit naive. One of the ways of being careful is knowing the difference between vandalism and a dispute. The banhammer must be swung gently so as not to come down on those expressing genuine quality concerns in awkward ways. I'm sitting on the fence over whether content experience is important to knowing that difference, and I regret that X!'s tool gives me no data about the candidate's contributions.&nbsp;[https://tools.wmflabs.org/xtools-ec/?user=K6ka&project=en.wikipedia.org] Similarly on the fence about scarcity of AfD indications.

#'''Neutral''' The lack of content creation is my main concern for this reason: how do you relate to content creators while acting as an administrator when you have little experience of it yourself? I would support granting the tools in six months if I saw some evidence of increased content creation, even just a couple of articles created, something taken to GAN or ITN or DYK. Don't need an FA or anything, but some evidence that the nominee can see things from the content creator's view would eliminate any lingering worries I have. -- [[User:Shudde|<font color="Blue">Shudde</font>]] <sup>[[User talk:Shudde|<font color="Blue">talk</font>]]</sup> 16:54, 6 January 2017 (UTC)
#I am not seeing any particular red flags here that would merit an oppose !vote. Much of the concern about content creation and AfD appears to be grounded in wiki-philosophical disagreements rather than actual tangible issues (and the notion that namespace percentages are somehow a reliable proxy for anything is silly bad). On the flip side, DeltaQuad's concern is reasonable and a lack of article work means there is little to outweigh it. And beware the "civility enforcement", that needs a lot more skill - and "but the other guy started first!"/"but I am right!" handling experience - than regular administration.

*After reviewing the Oppose !votes above, I'm having a hard time understanding how, why, and most especially when new article creation became the ''sine qua non'' of admin qualification.  Especially when, as is the case here, the admin candidate has both a record of and primary interest in vandal-fighting.  [[user:K6ka|K6ka]] expresses clear interest in not affecting New Pages or AfD.  There should be recognition of multiple paths to adminship instead of forcing every RfA into a specific editing resume.  To hold them to a standard requiring involvement in those areas they do not wish to affect seems like asking for overreach.  It strikes me as nothing wrong with a potential admin who acknowledges their limited interest on improving the project.  Indeed, creating notional requirements for accomplishment in many different areas of the project in order to give some-one the admin bit creates a distinct incentive for over-reaching editors trying to comply with such demands.  Adminship is not supposed to be a community award of some sort of superuser status; there is a reason it is often called being given the mop.  An editor who wants to wikignome their way into removing negative aspects of the project is at least as noteworthy as one that wikidragons their way into adding to it.

::Although I am not opposing this RfA, I will take a shot at answering the question above. I don't think that [xx] amount of content creation or AfD participation should be non-negotiable criteria. But it needs to be remembered that an Admin has all the tools, not just the ones they are planning on using. Whether or not you plan to use them, some of the tools are so commonly associated with the basic things that admins are expected to do from time to time, that you ''need'' to know how to use them, just in case. Knowing how to judge an article and what to do if it clearly needs to go is one of those. And that touches on both content creation and AfD. I personally do not expect expertise in any given field. But I do need to see evidence that a candidate has enough knowledge so that if they needed, or chose to get involved with an issue outside of their preferred area of concentration, that they can handle it. We need to remember that once you get the mop your talk page is going to become a magnet for all kinds of people with their own diverse problems. Obscure stuff is perfectly OK to ping another admin but being able to judge a dicey article, is something that I think all admins need to be able to do. Writing as a newly minted admin I can affirm from personal experience that in my one week on the job I've already run into a few things I wasn't expecting. It happens. -[[User:Ad Orientem|Ad Orientem]] ([[User talk:Ad Orientem|talk]]) 00:31, 2 January 2017 (UTC)
:::{{tq|...in my one week on the job I've already run into a few things I wasn't expecting. It happens.}} To a certain extent, that's kind of my point.  I don't understand the general desire expressed in recent RfA's for near-perfect editing resumes when on-the-job learning is a near-universal part of the new admin experience.  If this admin candidate has to learn about (say) closing AfD discussions, why is that such a bad thing?  They can't break the encyclopedia there unless they ''really'' [[wp:ROUGE|go rogue]] and there are mechanisms in place even if they do.

:::::Isn't part of RFA determining if a candidate has the community's trust?  One element of that would be that we trust the candidate to have enough self-awareness of their personal knowledge (and knowledge gaps) that they don't use tools they aren't comfortable using.  We also trust that they have enough of a [[WP:CLUE]] to educate themselves in areas where their knowledge is weak (be it through collaboration with other admins or users or through reading policies and prior discussions), should they have to take action in those areas.  For example, I would say that being able to put a block in place is a pretty basic administrative activity - but I can't count the number of times I've seen very experienced admins looking for a bit of guidance at ANI in establishing a range block.  They know their limitations, get help, and do what they have to do.  I'd be willing to wager that way more of those communications happen off-wiki.  Perhaps there is merit to being able to get some of the individual tools (such as viewing deleted articles or contribs) piecemeal, but until then I personally feel it's safe to have some faith in the people we trust.

:::There are two types of permissions groups on these sites: specialized and generalized. Specialized ones include rollback, template editor, CheckUser, etc - they have one main purpose, and you can evaluate candidates based on their ability to perform that main function. Generalized groups are basically admins and stewards - access is granted to a broad range of technical permissions that, for security and community reasons, are not available to all users. I don't think I've seen a candidate for adminship that has experience in absolutely all areas that the toolset encompasses, because by nature it is quite large. What becomes important here isn't specific experience, but transferable skills. Can the candidate easily find policies and interpret them well? Can they keep a level head and deal with conflict in a mature way? Do they have the competence to figure out what user hit a spam blacklist rule through the logs, in the same way that they could use the logs to see when a user was last blocked? Now, experience with the content side is a bit different because that is the "front-facing" side of the project, but I would argue that you could again look for those transferable skills. If the candidate can deal with disputes over renaming in a civil way, then they will most likely be able to do the same on an article talk page. Or at least that's my opinion of it :-) -- [[User:Ajraddatz|Ajraddatz]] ([[User Talk:Ajraddatz|talk]]) 01:30, 2 January 2017 (UTC)
*:{{ping|Eggishorn}} new article creation is not the ''sine qua non''  for adminship. It isn't even the most common argument in the fairly small oppose section here, several of whom don't even mention it. We have over 5.3 million articles not even 0.1% of which have reached FA status. There is an awful lot to do including a vast amount of content creation that doesn't involve creating new articles. The vast majority of the RFA community have no problem supporting candidates who never create new articles. Opposes for not having created new articles are a new fad, RFA has such things, a while back we had people opposed because of the percentage of automated edits. I suspect this fad too will pass. Insufficient content creation is a different matter and one where this candidate is close to one of the de facto criteria for adminship, hence my question 8. Clearly the candidate has some content contributions, sufficient for many to support but not for others. Having some content contributions has been part of the de facto requirements for admin since the unbundling of Rollback 8 years ago - before then "good vandalfighter" was sufficient to pass RFA. A significant proportion of the community or at least that part of the community who votes  at RFA expect that all new admins will have mastered the skill of creating inline citations to reliable sources. A candidate without content contributions won't pass RFA, whether this candidate has sufficient is the main area of disagreement between the Opposers and the Supporters.

*:Sorry Henry Winkler, you'll never be a Wikipedia administrator because your dyslexia would make content creation impossible. There are infinite types of human being, each with unique interests, cognitive uniqueness (me, I've got ADD), differing levels of English mastery, etc. The content creation mandate needlessly disqualifies trustworthy editors simply because they either don't have an interest in writing, or because they just may not be very strong at it.

*{{U|MartinZ02}}'s Question #9 is extremely poor. There's no correct answer, and it's set up to make the candidate look bad no matter how they answer. If they don't take the concerns seriously or just state they have different criteria for adminship than the opposers, they come across as arrogant and entitled. If they do take the concerns seriously but lay out how they believe they can be a net positive as an administrator, then opposers will throw the answer in their face and state that even the candidate doesn't feel they're fully qualified.

I've added some questions about AfD. K6ka, I've added in the incel AfD as a bit of an extra, so please don't feel like you need to answer that one if you don't want to. That's the process of a very long campaign to get involuntary celibacy onto Wikipedia and honestly, most admins would probably rather [[A Christmas Story|stick their tongue on a frozen flag pole]] than close that AfD. My thought process with that was just that if you can break down the reasons for the AfD closing the way it did and summarize it, then I honestly think that you'd be able to close anything, given how messy and protracted that whole AfD process was, as most AfDs are far more cut and dry than that and there's no requirement for admins to close an AfD.

*'''Oppose''' This editor appears to have taken the RfA process too lightly. As BU Rob13 notes, running for adminship with zero content creation record and against the advice of experienced editors, speaks of arrogance. This user has all of three AfD votes. While I agree that content awareness, not necessarily creation is all that's required for admins, I'm afraid that this user's contribs don't show much evidence of that either. This user has the time to maintain an overly extravagant user page, as well to edit and be an admin/crat at such wikis as the how-to wiki and others mentioned down his user page, but no time to do any actual writing work for the encyclopedia. Not to mention that the answer to Q1 is a bit alarming. "expect me to be a bit careful with the tools within the first week of adminship" ? So that means they don't intend to be careful with the tools after the first week? I'm also a bit concerned that they are a hat collector, as is often the case with cross-wiki vandal fighters. This user is not evil, but they certainly don't deserve the tools at the present time, or upon their first attempt. 103.6.159.67 (talk) 9:13 am, Today (UTC‚àí5) <small>Copied from talk page by --[[User:RegentsPark|regentspark]] <small>([[User talk:RegentsPark|comment]])</small> 02:27, 7 January 2017 (UTC)</small>
