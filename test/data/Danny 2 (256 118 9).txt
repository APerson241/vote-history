'''Final (256/118/9); Ended Tue, 10 Apr 2007 3:19 UTC'''

{{User|Danny}}

It is my pleasure to nominate [[User:Danny|Danny]] for adminship on the English Wikipedia.  For those of you who don't know, allow me to catch you up on some history.  Danny was first directly appointed to the role of admin by Jimbo, and then later, in 2003, his adminship was confirmed by RFa election.  He recently resigned his adminship upon resigning from official employment at the Foundation (where had been Grants Coordinator since 2005).  He resigned his adminship (as well as stewardship) to prevent any perceived conflicts of interest following leaving employment at WMF.  He hasn't yet revealed his reasons for resigning his role from the Foundation, but know that it has nothing whatsoever to do with any sort of disagreement with anything that Wikipedia itself stands for.  He also has extensive experience working on Wikisource, Wikimedia Commons, and the Hebrew Wikipedia.  His work on Wikipedia more than stands on its own, even ignoring any contributions he made in official capacities.

Danny is not done with his work on Wikipedia, not by a long shot, and it would help him in his continued work for the project to gain adminship rights back.  There isn't a single person in the entire world more familiar with Wikipedia than Danny.  Whereas Jimbo has been more of an absentee God-king, Danny was in the office every day from 9-5 working on some of the trickiest issues that Wikipedia faces, and then would often log on after work and help write articles.  He has an ungodly number of edits for anyone who cares about those kinds of things.  He's also handled all sorts of behind-the-scenes stuff that few have ever heard about, but was vital all the same.

Danny has been making huge contributions to Wikipedia since before most current Wikipedians even ever heard about it.  For instance, he wrote the original biography infoboxes and put them on all of the articles on US presidents.  This was a harder task than it now seems, because neither templates nor wiki table syntax had even been coded yet, so Danny learned HTML and created all of those infoboxes from scratch.  Most people with high edit counts have done a lot of counter-vandalism work; in contrast, Danny has done very little.  Nearly all of his edits have been significant edits improving the quality of the encyclopedia.  Danny's excellent judgment, skills, and unparalleled knowledge of Wikipedia make him the perfect administrator candidate.

Making Danny an administrator again is as obvious a decision as any we're liable to find on Wikipedia.  Yes, Danny has been involved in some controversy, but that's utterly unavoidable when you consider how much time he spent working here and how many controversial situations his position required him to get involved in (for instance, almost every [[WP:OFFICE]] case).  The qualification for adminship is simply "do we trust him?", and I can't think of anyone I would answer that question about more strongly in the affirmative for than someone who has been deeply involved with Wikipedia and the Wikimedia Foundation for five years.

:''Candidate, please indicate acceptance of the nomination here:''

I accept. [[User:Danny|Danny]] 01:08, 3 April 2007 (UTC)

<!--The candidate may make an optional statement here-->
<noinclude>====Questions for the candidate====</noinclude>
<includeonly>'''Questions for the candidate'''</includeonly>
Dear candidate, thank you for offering to serve Wikipedia in this capacity. Please take the time to answer a few generic questions to provide guidance for participants:
:'''1.''' What sysop chores do you anticipate helping with?
::'''A:''' I don't think there is a valid answer to this question because it limits the role of the sysop. I believe that a sysop is a janitor, a person who helps to clean up the site and keep it functioning. If I were asked, in an interview for a janitorial position, what tasks I anticipate, would I be exempt from any other tasks that needed doing? If I said I would clean up spills, I would still have to fix broken windows. So, I simply anticipate doing what needs to be done and is within the scope of my ability. Surprise me. [[User:Danny|Danny]]

:'''2.''' Of your articles or contributions to Wikipedia, are there any with which you are particularly pleased, and why?
::'''A:''' Five years. I am particularly pleased that I stuck it out for five years. I've seen lots of changes, lots of people come and go, I have had exhilirating moments and extremely frustrating moments, but I am still here. Of that I am proud. [[User:Danny|Danny]]

:'''3.''' Have you been in any conflicts over editing in the past or have other users caused you stress? How have you dealt with it and how will you deal with it in the future?
::'''A:''' You can't be involved with editing without being involved in conflict. You can't be involved in Wikipedia without seeing your blood pressure rise on occasion. And you can't have one single way to deal with each situation. [[User:Danny|Danny]]

'''Optional question by [[User:Xiner]]'''
:'''4.''' Would you like to respond to the concerns brought up by AnonEMouse and trialsanderrors?
::'''A:''' I don't think thet are concerns. I think they are misconceptions. I believe that administrators have a responsibility for the site, i.e., they have to be willing to make decisions, and they have to recognize that sometimes their decisions will be unpopular, because there is no single answer that will please everyone. No matter what is said, the spammer will still complain that spam was removed, the person writing a vanity article about themselves will complain that it was removed, the person posting a copyright violation will complain that it is removed. Not everything has to be discussed ''ad nauseum'', because that only provides greater ammunition to the spammer, the vanity author, and the copyright violator. They come back thinking, "Hey, I convinced some people. If I push a little harder, perhaps I can convince more." In fact, that is what happened with the Israel News Agency, a man who I spoke to, who told me on the phone that I have a responsibility as a Jew to allow him to use Wikipedia for his own SEO purposes and to promote his pet (POV) causes. I believe that Wikipedia has to enforce its own rules, rather than continuously water them down in an attempt to please everyone. With some 10 thousand spam links a day being added to Wikipedia, and people calling regularly to ask about how they can promote themselves or their businesses, it is time to act. I realize that this may be an unpopular view, but it is not something I would compromise on. Decide accordingly. I will not water down my views to win a vote. 

::'''B:''' That said, I do not believe I am infallible. I have made mistakes, and can list much better examples than those brought here. On the other hand, Wikipedia is a product that allows for mistakes, because mistakes are so easy to fix. If other admins or other users disagree with me, that is fine. I will present my opinions, listen to theirs, and if no compromise is attainable, accept the verdict of the majority. I have done so in the past, and I do not see myself acting differently in the future. The beauty is that even if I was wrong, it can be corrected. The good thing is that I can accept if I was wrong, instead of feeling a need to argue the point till the cows come home, which is more and more frequently what is happening on Wikipedia, on the talk pages and on the mailing lists. Do we want to build an encyclopedia or read our opinions on line? If it is the latter, I suggest that the blogosphere is a better place for it.

::'''C:''' As for edit summaries--I have been around for a very long time, from a time, in fact, where edit summaries were not common practice. It takes some time for an old dog to learn new tricks. At the suggestion of someone below, I have changed my preferences to require me to add edit summaries. That said, I think, and have always thought, that far too much emphasis is being placed on the way an edit is made than on the quality of the contribution. That is unfortunate. On that same note, I think far too much onus is placed on the fluff answers people want to see than on the honest answers people should see. [[User:Danny|Danny]] 05:01, 4 April 2007 (UTC)


'''Optional question by [[User:Trialsanderrors|trialsanderrors]]'''
:'''5.''' I would actually like to make this more specific: Why do think that the contributions by {{User|Ekraam}}, who added an (attributed) copy of the [http://www.computingbusiness.co.uk/computing-business/features/2169333/top-world ''Computing Business'' article] on [[HSBC]] senior executive [http://www.cio.co.uk/mis100/companyprofile/index.cfm?companyid=16  Rumi Contractor] warrants a month-long block without warning or explanation rather than to point him/her towards out copyright and inclusion policies ?
::'''A:''' I think my answer above explains my position. To be more specific, this was obviously spam intended to promote someone who would not be included in a normal encycloepdia--a regional CIO? C'mon? Do we have an article about Carolyn Doran (the COO of the WMF), of the CIO of Suntrust Bank (my bank)? As for using a copyrighted text, that is generally done when people do not want us to be able to edit the content. On the phone I have heard numerous times, "That is the official bio, and it shoudl not have to be edited." I do not believe spammers are coming to Wikipedia in good faith to improve the encyclopedia. They are coming to promote a POV agenda, and should be treated as such. Their interests are not our interests, and it behooves us to realize that now, before it is too late. Once again, I realize that this will be an unpopular answer, and I invite you to vote accordingly. [[User:Danny|Danny]] 05:07, 4 April 2007 (UTC)

'''Optional question by [[User:Geogre]]'''
:'''6.''' What is the value and role of IRC for an administrator to Wikipedia?  What is the value and role of an ostensibly private and "admins-only" discussion forum that cannot be examined for violations of decorum or policy?  Finally, what is the responsibility of those "in charge" of such fora to be 100% aware of the on-wiki controversies and polemics of the participants in such channels, and especially those with "operator" access?  (I wish that I had never needed to ask this.) [[User:Geogre|Geogre]] 12:21, 4 April 2007 (UTC)
::'''A:''' There are several questions here, and I will try to respond to all of them. First, I believe that IRC is a valuable forum, though its importance is over-emphasized. I do believe that communications are vital for the success of everything we do, and that IRC provides one venue for such communication, but it should not be the only venue. I also think that too much time is wasted on IRC in general chats, gossip, and, frankly, pretty stupid discussions at times. This is detrimental to the project, but it is, unfortunately, also inevitable given our size, and given the fact that people want to be doing something, but aren't quite sure what it is they should be doing. Many months ago, I wrote an [[User:Danny/What next|essay]] on this very topic. I also think it helps promotes cliques and factions, though not to the extreme that some people would have us think. After all, in a project of this size, with this number of contributors, all with slightly different views, cliques and factions ar inevitable. Finally, I think IRC or some equivalent would inevitably have emerged, whether people want it to or not. On the other hand, you seem to be indicating the admin channel in particular. I was one of the people that advocated the creation of that channels, so that hot-button topics could be dealt with quickly and effectively. I believe that should still be the goal of the admin channel, though that is not always the case. I do not believe it should be limited to admins (I am on the channel, though I am not presently an admin), but at the same time, I do not believe we should not institute a new category of "trusted users." I believe that certain matters need to be discussed in confidence among certain very active users who have proved themselves (for example, vandalism that could have very negative legal or press implications), but I do not believe that this is necessarily the role played by the admin channel today. Finally, I believe that people have to look beyond the status of any of these titles--admin, bureaucrat, steward, office--thinking that by obtaining one they are climbing in stature within Wikipedia. It is not about status, but about improving the encyclopedia, which is what all fora for communication should be about. [[User:Danny|Danny]] 12:42, 4 April 2007 (UTC)

'''Optional question by [[User:A. B.|A. B.]]'''
:'''7.''' Would you add your name to the [[:Category:Administrators open to recall]]?--[[User:A. B.|A. B.]] [[User talk:A. B.|<sup>(talk)</sup>]] 16:51, 4 April 2007 (UTC)
::'''A:''' The question of admin recall reminds me of a very old question (early 2003, I believe) of reconfirming admins. I believed in it, and set an example by being the first admin to run for reconfirmation. I passed, and that gave greater justification to my adminship, since before that I was actually appointed (there were no elections once). I gave up my adminship again some months later, while on a wikibreak, and asked to be reelected. I succeeded and was still an admin until last week, when I volutarily relinquished it again because my status in the foundation changed, and I did not want anyone thinking that my adminship was a relic of that status. In fact, I was an admin before there was even a foundation. I think these actions speak louder than any list. I have relinquished my adminship. [[User:Danny|Danny]] 17:01, 4 April 2007 (UTC)
::: Clarification, please: your history certainly speaks louder than membership in a category, but will you ''also'' add yourself to that category, if only as a formality, or will you not do so, as a rejection of the idea of that category? --[[User:AnonEMouse|AnonEMouse]] <sup>[[User_talk:AnonEMouse|(squeak)]]</sup> 17:08, 4 April 2007 (UTC)
:::: I believe that such a process should fall on all admins, without exception, not just those who are willing to list their names. I would support a poll for regular reconfirmation of admins. I would not link myself to that category. In general, I think categories should be used to classify content, not contributors. [[User:Danny|Danny]] 17:17, 4 April 2007 (UTC) 

'''Optional question by [[User:Dragons flight|Dragons flight]]'''
:'''8.''' In your OFFICE role, you have had the luxury of asserting a greater authority than ordinary admins.  For good or ill, the community generally would have had little recourse to challenge your decisions.  Obviously there are times when the nature of your OFFICE role required action (including possibly secret action) that would deviate from the normal policies, process, and standards of behavior for ordinary admins on Wikipedia.  However, the issue raised by some of the opposers is whether your behavior differed from that normally expected of admins even at times when there wasn't a pressing reason to do so.  I would like you address whether or not you feel your actions in the past have been consistent with the normal standards for admin behavior, and whether you are prepared to abide by the expectations laid out in policies such as [[WP:DEL]], [[WP:CSD]], [[WP:BLOCK]], and [[WP:BITE]] even if you disagree with aspects of how those policies are currently constructed.  [[User:Dragons flight|Dragons flight]] 18:33, 4 April 2007 (UTC)
::'''A.''' The whole issue of using OFFICE is a red herring. I only used office as Dannyisme, and even then, there were only 28 edits made using that name, 13 to the main namespace, and all of those on the same 4 or 5 articles at the request of Jimmy or Brad. Anything else I did (with the exception of the first time I used OFFICE, which was as Danny), was done under this user name. I feel that, as Danny, I have followed the policies mentioned above, though I did not take them to ridiculous extremes. In fact, it was me who came up with the idea of BLP tagging in the first place, so I am quite comfortable that I behaved accordingly, based on information that I had. The only issue I see as possibly valid is [[WP:BITE]], and as I indicated before, I do not think that spammers and the like should be regarded as "harmless newbies, trying to help build an encyclopedia." They are here with an agenda--to promote their product, cause, self, etc., and frankly, they don't give a damn about our own policies, except as means of self-promotion. When I am told on the phone that Fleshlight is interested in having its article in the main namespace solely as a means of promotion, I have no qualms about deleting it. In cases of spam or obvious bad intent, I will continue to bite. [[User:Danny|Danny]] 18:59, 4 April 2007 (UTC)  

'''Optional question by [[User:Xiner]]'''
:'''9.''' My chief concerns about your candidacy is best laid out in an essay about [http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?VestedContributor the vested contributor]. Could you address it?
::'''A:''' I disagree with the assumption of the article. Experience has a role to play in all aspects of life, including editing a wiki. To assume otherwise is patent nonsense. [[User:Danny|Danny]] 18:48, 4 April 2007 (UTC)

'''Optional question by [[User:ChazBeckett]]'''
:'''10.''' Why do you believe nearly 25% of particants in this RfA are opposed to granting adminship? If this RfA succeeds, will this relatively high level of opposition affect your behavior as an admin? [[User:ChazBeckett|ChazBeckett]] 16:15, 5 April 2007 (UTC)
::'''A:''' I really cannot speak for all of the people who are opposed. I think their concerns are genuine, though I think that they are overlooking some of the other things i have done. I am not one for tooting my own horn, and I don't intend to list them all here, but I have been a successful mediator, I turned down checkuser because I thought I had too much power as it is, and I was the first to initiate mentoring of vandals. In fact, I advocated strongly for two people who I thought could continue to make significant contributions to Wikipedia despite the fact that they were immediately tagged as vandals (Mike Garcia and Wik). In that I believe I took a more concilliatory approach than many of the people opposing me here. I also think that RfA is not a reflection of the community--it is more a reflection of the RfA patrollers. Too many good, established users avoid it. That is unfortunate. I think that "Assume good faith" has lost its meaning, and is now used as a bludgeon against people--rather than genuinely assuming good faith themselves, people are more apt to point out when someone else did not assume good faith. In that alone, Wikipedia is losing some of its moral highground, and it saddens me. Finally, I am disturbed by some of the advice I am getting--"Tell them what they want to hear." I can only question the efficacy of a process in which people are encouraged to '''not''' say what they really think to win a vote. I have been very honest in my answers. I don't believe that there is one pat solution for every problem, or one single way to act. I think each situation should be judged as unique and responded to accordingly. So, in response to your last question, I will not give the pat answer everyone would like to see, and which no one really keeps to anyways. I will act as I have said I will. I will evaluate each situation, make judgments based on experience, and act accordingly. As for conflicts I have been in, that is certainly true. I have been in conflicts in the past. I anticipate being in conflicts in the future, whether I am an admin or not. How can I be involved with seeing Wikipedia grow and flourish, overcome problems, and become the amazing resource it can be if I am not willing to get my hands dirty every now and again? [[User:Danny|Danny]] 17:26, 5 April 2007 (UTC)
:::Danny states above that ''"RfA is not a reflection of the community--it is more a reflection of the RfA patrollers."''  Worthy of note is the fact that Danny's is an extremely well-attended RFA, and he has received more votes opposing his nomination than most successful candidates ever receive in support of theirs, currently representing almost 30 percent of the total votes cast.  Moreover, many of the neutral votes cast (including my own) and votes cast in support of Danny are qualified by concerns about Danny's personal style.  While I am not a bureaucrat -- nor do I ever hope to be -- if I were, I would have to conclude that Danny's nomination has failed to obtain a consensus in favor of his nomination, and I will continue to watch with interest to see how this RfA is eventually closed. // [[User:Netesq|Internet Esquire]] 07:27, 9 April 2007 (UTC)

'''Optional question by [[User:ElinorD]]'''
:'''11.''' Recently I have seen discussion about whether or not it is permissable (and whether or not it ''should'' be permissable) to link to sites such as Encyclopaedia Dramatica, Daniel Brandt's site, and Wikipedia Review, which either attack individual editors/administrators, or post their personal details (or in some cases do both). There is also the question as to whether posting a nowiki'd URL in the case of a site which has been blacklisted is (or should be) allowed. If you had the power to make (or vote on) such decisions, what position would you take? [[User:ElinorD|ElinorD]] [[User talk:ElinorD|(talk)]] 17:18, 5 April 2007 (UTC)
::'''A:''' I do not understand the question: 1. How does linking to these sites enhance the quality of the encyclopedia we are trying to build? 2. How does this impact my performance as an admin? [[User:Danny|Danny]] 17:32, 5 April 2007 (UTC)
:::'''Clarification:''' Okay, I'll clarify. How does linking to these sites enhance the quality of the encyclopaedia? There is currently an article about Daniel Brandt. Should it or should it not have links to his site? There was an article about Encyclopaedia Dramatica. While I'm not familiar with all the details, I think it was deleted in part because the existence of such an article was inviting the posting of links to it, if not on the article itself, then on the talk page. When that article existed, should links to it have been permitted? With regard to the relevance this has to your performance as an admin, admins have the power to block people who post links to sites that give names and addresses of editors. Admins have the power to delete such links from page histories. They have the power to protect a page where such links are being posted. They also have the power to undo such blocks, deletions, and protections performed by other admins. Some editors feel that allowing such links is condoning and enabling real-life stalking. Other editors feel that forbidding such links is a form of censorship. Since every prospective admin will, if the RfA is successful, be given tools that will enable him to strengthen one or other of those two conflicting positions, it would be useful, before voting, to know which side you would support. [[User:ElinorD|ElinorD]] [[User talk:ElinorD|(talk)]] 17:49, 5 April 2007 (UTC)
:::::If it is the policy of the Foundation not to link to those sites, I will enforce it. As an admin, I do not make policy. [[User:Danny|Danny]] 18:05, 5 April 2007 (UTC)

'''Optional question by [[User:Irpen]]'''
:'''11.''' Since the administrators are very much involved in hot issues that include the ''live users'' and content creators, be it the conflict resolutions or policies that do not have the clear cut interpretations and require case by case approach, it is very important that the administrators do not loose touch with the editors' concerns through remaining continuously involved in content writing themselves. In view of this, I am concerned with your answer to Q2. Are you able to demonstrate by your ''relatively recent'' contributions that you still did not loose interest in the content writing, which is the main purpose of this project? 
::'''A''' [[Iran-Iraq boundary]] is the most recent article I am most proud of. I have also done a lot of content adding to Wikisource, linking it to Wikipedia to provide resources for articles. [[User:Danny|Danny]] 18:01, 5 April 2007 (UTC)

'''Optional question by [[User:Pascal.Tesson]]'''
:'''13''' I'm not so comfortable with some of your above answers to editor questions. You certainly realize that many are unhappy about your occasional disregard of policy, common practice and the community in general. I'm sure you believed you acted for the greater good of Wikipedia but the community doesn't give someone admin rights because they think that person knows better than anyone what's right for Wikipedia. We give them these rights because we trust that they will follow the rules and practices we have set up and will consult with the community should they choose otherwise or find that these rules need to be changed. Are you confident that your position of authority hasn't made you lose track of that principle? For instance, do you still believe that it's currently ok to issue prolonged blocks without warning to users you believe are spammers? [[User:Pascal.Tesson|Pascal.Tesson]] 21:19, 5 April 2007 (UTC)
::'''A:''' Actually, I am opposed to the excessive legalism and process that has emerged over the past few years. I think there are way too many rules--too many in fact to get on with the real task in hand, which is creating a font of knowledge. I have no idea how many rules pages there are now, but they number in the thousands. I would prefer a much simpler approach, a single page. Esperanto grammar has sixteen rules. We can model ourselves on that. Or even more simply, I would suggest a greater adherence to [[Wikipedia:Five_pillars|the Five Pillars]], including the last one. Or do we not really mean that. As for the opposition to me and what I am saying, I tend to look at a glass as being three-quarters full, rather than one-quarter empty. And I am glad that people are actually considering some of the issues I am raising (as you are doing, just by asking this question). Maybe change is possible. [[User:Danny|Danny]] 21:32, 5 April 2007 (UTC)

'''Optional question from [[User:Bastique|Bastique]]'''
:'''14''' There have been several remarks about the nature of your office actions.  Can you provide further explanation about what an office action is and in what context you were performing them?
::'''A:''' I find the whole question of office actions moot. To be clear, there were 7 office actions performed--6 under Dannyisme and only one under this user name. In each instance, I did not make the decision, but was instructed to do so by the General Counsel of the Wikimedia Foundation in response to a looming legal threat. I never had the authority to do or undo office actions, despite the misperception, because I was the one who actually put the tag in place. The last time I did so was Nov. 7, i.e., 5 months ago. Because of the high visibility office actions engendered, they were essentially abandoned. [[User:Danny|Danny]] 23:00, 5 April 2007 (UTC)

'''Optional question from [[User:Cool Cat|Cool Cat]]'''
:'''15''' I was wondering if you could provide some examples of your offline/online office actions you were involved in. What kinds of issues did you deal with? --<small> [[User:Cool Cat|Cat]]</small> <sup>[[User talk:Cool Cat|chi?]]</sup> 22:59, 5 April 2007 (UTC)
::'''A:''' First and foremost, I dealt with everyday money issues. I worked closely with the bank, helped with the audit, worked on the fundraiser, went in search of grants and donations. I did pretty well at that. I also answered the phone--again and again and again. It was a hiodgepodge of people from senators and congressmen (remember when they were changing Wikipedia?) -- to celebrities when we got the facts wrong -- to people who wanted articles about themselves (I was number 18 on American Idol. How am I supposed to get famous if there is no article about me) -- to publicity hounds (Osama Bin Laden's mistress comes to mind) who want their articles to say what ''they'' want -- to spammers ("Hey, I am trying to advertise my company on your website and someone changed what I wrote. Can you lock it? If not I will sue you and your family.") -- to kooks -- to serious legal threats -- to people asking how to get the coyotes out of their backyard. Yesterday I had dinner with someone who was in the office one day. He said that in the two hours he was there I field four calls that impressed him. I don't remember the first, but there was the family of a child actor who was being stalked, Osama's lady friend, and the police in Wisconsin who wanted someone who could read runes (don't ask, but suffice it to say they were written in blood). Then there were schools, lots of schools, calling because rival schools called their football team faggots or their computer club, idiot savants, or some teacher, a pedophile. And I can go on and on ... Get me drunk and  will tell you about the Elders of of Mother Earth, calling from Deutschland ... that is Germany ... on Gaia ... which is the planet Earth ...

Hi Danny! I'm retired now from the project but I hope you don't mind if I pop by to ask you a few questions:

:*To help shut down ''the gossip and second-guessing'', would you please explain why you suddenly resigned from all your positions of power and authority last month?
::* As I have said before, I will make my positions known during the upcoming board election. For now, suffice it to say that I believe that the board has not completely met the expectations I had of it, both as a Wikipedian and an employee. I believe that at this point in my life, I can be a greater asset to the WMF as a board member than I can as an employee. [[User:Danny|Danny]] 19:14, 6 April 2007 (UTC)
:::*Why wait? Why not make it known now? What can you tell us then that you won't now? If your positions on the issues are strong, surely it would only help your case to get out the word early. If they are not so strong, all the better to get them out in the open so they can be adjusted accordingly.--[[User:R.D.H. (Ghost In The Machine)|R.D.H. (Ghost In The Machine)]] 21:45, 8 April 2007 (UTC)

:*It is common knowledge that you recommended Essjay to Ms. Stacey Schiff to interview as a "model" Wikipedian. But what role, if any, did you have in the Foundation's hiring of Ryan Jordan? And what, if any, actions did you take when the extent of his fraud became apparent?
::* I recommended several people to Stacy Schiff, among the Essjay. She interviewed several of them, but the Essjay story was certainly intriguing. Hey, I was also interviewed, but the editors decided to cut the piece about me. As for the next question, the Foundation did not hire Ryan Jordan. Wikia did, and as I am not employed by Wikia, I cannot comment on that. I had nothing to do with it. I took no actions when what you call the "fraud" became apparent. I do not agree with what Ryan did, and would not do so myself, but I do not think he should be thrown to the dogs. He made a mistake, as have I on many occassions, as have we all.

:::Opps, my mistake [[Shell game|wrong shell]]. But, as you point out below, we all make them.  And indeed mistakes should be forgiven if they are not serious or repeated. What R.J. did was, however.

:*Would you please explain [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Requests_for_adminship&diff=prev&oldid=73975257 This edit] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&type=delete&user=Danny&page=Joel+Leyden This one]? And do you really find consensus building to be "tiresome" and prefer just to delete out of process when in doubt? And if so, how is this approach compatible with the building of an encyclopedia by a community governed by consensus and trust? 
::*Above I explained that Joel Leyden called the office and expressed that his sole purpose was to spam Wikipedia. I have worked in Israeli media, and I know many prominent people in Israeli news media. None had ever heard of him. It was an obvious attempt at spamming and POV-pushing, and that conclusion was drawn by investigating the matter beyond just looking at the web. I also found that he used sock and meat puppets to influence the vote on his VfD. In effect, I was following policy, and he was trolling. YOu need only read his blog to see the ludicrous degree he has taken this. And no, I do not support al-Qaeda, and the only reason we did not speak Hebrew on the phone was that I spoke too quickly for him to understand.

:'''18''' There is speculation as to the extent of your further political aspirations within the WMF, to which this RfA (as opposed to simply asking to be given your admin bit back, something you could have easily done) would be a first step. Your answer above, ''I can be a greater asset to the WMF as a board member than I can as an employee'' seemingly reinforces this idea. I would like to hear your side to this speculation, and your current plans as member of Wikipedia. Do you intend to be just another admin and work in the trenches, or do you indeed hold political plans within WMF in the future?

Are you somehow implying that none of the (so far) ''59'' opposers have a valid criticism that could help you improve, or that you have no room for improvement, or that you are not interested in listening to the constructive criticism expressed by many of them?

:::Sorry to butt-in but as a supporter, I'd like to note that the 75% of people who still believe the net effect of you re-adminship would be positive don't necessarily agree with all of your less-likeable habits. I find most of the criticism perfectly valid and taking it into account would not lose you the respect of your supporters. Saying "I get the message" for the sake of getting support is of course ridiculous (as you've pointed out) but saying "take me as I am" is an even worse option. People want you to be more patient, less agressive, more courteous and you can do all of that without diminishing your efficiency as an admin.

::::As one who remains strongly neutral to Danny's nomination, I echo these sentiments, and Danny's dismissive attitude towards the minority is becoming more and more troubling to me.  Wikipedia is not a democracy, and a super-majority of 75 percent support does not translate into a mandate. // [[User:Netesq|Internet Esquire]] 02:29, 9 April 2007 (UTC)
:::::Since we're going to have a conversation here, it seems.. I thought I might point out that in my view Danny clarified his position here in the supplemental statement he left below.

What he's claiming is that 25% isn't a mandate.. this doesn't imply that 75% is either. Below in his statement he explains that there is no numerical percentage that overrides doing the right thing. I'm confident that Danny will take to heart all of the points which seems like a good idea after some reflection, no matter which side they come from.--[[User:Gmaxwell|Gmaxwell]] 02:37, 9 April 2007 (UTC)
::::::As the subject of what may well be the most contentious RfA in Wikipedia's history, I can only say that I thought the question was rather silly. Would Stewart have said "Bush won 75% of the vote but doesn't act like he is president of 100% of the population"? Is the authority of an admin equal to that of a president? Is there no recourse for admin actions if they prove wrong? Deleting an article is hardly the equivalent of strafing a city. As someone once said about Wikipedia, and academic debates in general, "The tensions are so high because the stakes are so low."
::::::Having said that, I want to add that this RfA has been very painful to me. It hurts me to see me portrayed as some arrogant, uncaring monster, and I can only hope that the people who really know me, who have worked with me on a day-to-day basis, do not feel that. I do not think they do, even realizing that I can be passionate about what I believe. Still, the bitterness that this RfA is evoking really does pain me. 
::::::I am not someone who likes to talk of his achievements, so I will not do that here. It ill becomes this forum to devolve into "You were mean here!" "Oh, yeah, well I was nice here." I learned long ago that you cannot win a principled argument with words, but only by example. I continue to believe that. Nevertheless, in a break from my usual reticence, I will say that I believe that I have shown good faith, to new users (I find the term newbie condescending) and to veterans alike. I have helped them through difficult times, and have learned from them, just as I hope they have learned from me. I hope to continue in that vein, whether I am an admin or not, and only regret that people cannot see the other side of the coin that is not being shown here.

::'''A:''' [[Tashkent]]--I know because I made the [[commons:Image:Tashkent_EN.PNG|map]]. [[User:Danny|Danny]]

'''Question from Flcelloguy'''
:'''22.''' Danny, this is going to be a long question, so please bear with me as I give some background on the situation that led to [[User:Eloquence|Erik's]] desysopping and indefinite blocking by yourself. Also recognize that I - and I'm sure all of us - appreciate a lot of the work you have done here; your contributions are valued. However, I would like some additional answers - or at least a clarification of the situation - regarding this incident in April. I note that you've addressed this incident directly above, commenting that "''there were circumstances that I will not go into that led to the blocking of Erik,''" and that you "''will decline to say any more than that.''" While you are free to decline to say any more on this matter, I just wanted to give you this opportunity to elucidate on the situation more or answer some of my questions, if you would like, or otherwise, state that there were circumstances, legal or other, that cannot be discussed in public. So here goes:

:The situation began with your stubbing and protection of [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=NewsMax.com&diff=48879219&oldid=48758172 NewsMax.com] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Christopher_Ruddy&diff=48879504&oldid=48365799 Christopher Ruddy], with you citing "POV qualms" in your edit summary. In your protection, there was no indication at all that the protection and stubbing arose from any communication in the office. You used the standard {{tl|protected}} template, even though I had created {{tl|office}} [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Office&action=history], a specific template, so that it would be more explicit which articles were protected because of legal reasons and which ones were not, and had informed you of its creation, which you acknowledged. Some editors noticed this stubbing and wondered whether or not it should be considered an OFFICE action, and raised a query at [[Wikipedia talk:Office Actions/Archive one#Still in use?|Wikipedia talk:Office Actions]]. [[User:Splash|Splash]], at this point, asked Danny for [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Danny&diff=prev&oldid=49010396 clarification], and Danny replied, saying that [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Splash&diff=49018307&oldid=48959223 "if I do something like that, please assume it is with office authority."] This was pointed out on the thread at Wikipedia talk:Office Actions, and another editor listed both of the pages under the section of protected and stubbed articles. This editor, who was not an administrator, also requested on the talk page that an administrator tag the articles with the appropriate template or at least place them in the category of Office actions. Because I had that page watchlist, I obliged with the request, per Danny's indication that they were Office actions. I was comfortable doing so because Danny had already indicated that they were Office actions in his response, and because he had mistakenly used the generic {{tl|protected}} tag in the past before and had not raised objections to people changing it to the newly-created {{tl|office}} template.

:However, my edits were soon reverted and deleted by [[User:Kelly Martin|Kelly Martin]]. She deleted my edit and changed it back to the {{tl|protected}} tag, and also sent an email to me advising me that she knew what she was doing. It was at this point that I noticed that another administrator had already changed the tag once before, per the discussion and Danny's own response, and had been reverted, using admin rollback, by Danny himself. This admin rollback was not only problematic in that it was not being used to remove vandalism but a good-faith edit, but also was still unclear about whether the article should have been tagged with Office. (Was he removing the tag because they were not office actions? Was he removing them because he didn't want them tagged?) These two edits had also been deleted by Kelly Martin, and because I did not check the deleted history of the page, was unaware of this. Thus, these four edits - two changings of the tags, one by myself, and another by [[User:ContiE|ContiE]], each citing Danny's own words and believing that he simply forgot to use the appropriate tag, were deleted. (They are still in the deleted history today.)

:Danny also made a comment to the thread on Wikipedia talk:Office Actions, commenting "''Undone. Please assume good faith.''" The entirety of his comment was vague and ambigious, and discussion followed - although Danny himself did not comment any further - about whether or not the action should be construed as being under the OFFICE tag. Other admins later re-added the article to the Office protected category, and the {{tl|Office}} tag was re-added at least [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=NewsMax_Media&diff=49222755&oldid=49177097 once.]

: During all of this, [[User:Eloquence|Erik Moller]], another highly respected sysop and now a Board member, noticed the protections and disagreed with them. Believing them to be a standard administrative action, he unprotected the articles, though he did not revert the stubbing, and left a note on the talk page. Erik's post on the mailing list goes into more detail about this: [http://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2006-April/044084.html], and another post elucidates further [http://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2006-April/044120.html]. Though his actions may not have been optimal, they were in no way dangerous or explicitly wrong; he saw an administrative action he disagreed with, a protection of an article for "POV qualms", and unprotected it, leaving a note for discussion. However, Danny then proceeded to immediately [http://meta.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&type=&user=Danny&page=User%3AEloquence%40enwiki desysop] Erik both here and on [http://meta.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&type=&user=Danny&page=User%3AEloquence Meta], and indefinitely blocked him on Meta as well as [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&type=&user=Danny&page=User%3AEloquence here], citing "reckless endangerment - OFFICE" as the entirety of his reason. This block was then reversed (see the [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&type=&user=&page=User%3AEloquence block log]) by [[User:The Epopt|The Epopt]], who cited in his unblock log that he was "revers[ing] insane indefinite block". Danny then reblocked again, with no comments at all, again for an indefinite period and placing "recklessness" in his block log. After a large public outcry after Erik's appeal on the mailing list, Danny then proceeded to shorten the block to 48 hours, saying "recklessness--as agreed with erik and counsel--acting in office capacity". Jimbo then stepped in at this point, unblocking Erik from enWiki ([[User:Angela|Angela]] unblocked him on Meta), and asking that his sysop rights be restored on both Meta and enWiki, which they were.

:Now, this whole situation is summarized in a [[Wikipedia:Wikipedia Signpost/2006-04-24/Office actions|''Signpost'']] article, but I feel that I've given a more complete account of the events. To this day, there has not been an explanation or apology from Danny, though I'm happy to see the two have since reconciled. (See question number four in [[Wikipedia:Wikipedia Signpost/2006-10-09/Eloquence interview|this interview]] with Erik I did for the ''Signpost''.) However, to quote Erik, Danny's actions and judgment at this time were a bit of an "overreaction". What I would like to know, Danny, is whether or not you consider this incident one the mistakes you have made. Was it? If not, why were you not more forthcoming in the whole debacle? A lack of communications was a huge problem, but all it would have taken was a short note explaining that there were legal issues that could not be publicly disclosed. Yet throughout this whole incident and afterwards, you did not elucidate, clarify, or in any way comment on what happened - the sudden and uncalled for indefinite blocking and desysopping of one of our longtime contributors - and even refused to talk to Erik when he called you to inquire about what happened. I'm just asking you and giving you, Danny, this opportunity to elucidate on what happened. Of course, you are under no obligation at all to answer the question, given your reticence and reluctance to speak about the topic in the earlier question, but I - and I'm sure many others - would love to hear your point of view and your comments on this.

:Thank you very much, Danny, and congratulations if you've (you referring to the reader, not Danny) read through all of this without skimming. :-) (If you did skim, I encourage you to go back and read all of it carefully; it was a very complex situation.) Thanks! [[User:Flcelloguy|Flcelloguy]] <small>([[User talk:Flcelloguy|A <font color="brown">note?</font>]])</small> 22:56, 7 April 2007 (UTC)

::I do want to note that Danny, as well as another independent third party, has since emailed me with regards to this question and the situation in April. There were facts that I had been previously unaware of, being private in nature. While I am still certainly not condoning anyone's actions here, because mistakes were made by all the involved parties, Danny included, (and the fact that some of the information regarding the situation is still disputed), I am comfortable now with his explanation, which I think (combined with the third party's further expoundment of the situation) is sufficient. Certainly, things could have been handled a lot better, but I do feel that he has answered my questions to the best of his ability.

::However, he also requested in his email that the details regarding the situation be kept confidential, a request that I will of course honor. It is not my decision whether or not to release these details; it is his, and his alone. Of course, I understand that some of you will still be frustrated by this lack of information - something which I completely empathize with - but I do want to emphasize that it is not up to me now to provide more information. I asked the question (along with the background of events) because I could not, in good conscience, have either supported or opposed without raising the issues and concerns that I had, and with the question being asked, I have now received what I feel is a satisfactory response.

'''Question from Wooyi'''
: '''29''' Danny, you stated that your actions on [[WP:OFFICE]] were intended to prevent libel suit against the foundation. While I wholeheartedly believe your statement is true and I appreciate your efforts, I'd like to inquire that, the website [[Wikitruth]] has posted those deleted libelous materials that were once on Wikipedia, why hasn't anyone sued Wikitruth for those libelous materials? If Wikitruth would not be sued for those materials, why Wikipedia would be? [[User:Wooyi|Wooyi]]<sup>[[User talk:Wooyi|Talk]], [[Wikipedia:Editor review/Wooyi|Editor review]]</sup> 05:24, 8 April 2007 (UTC)
::I actually do think this is a serious question. My answer would be that Wikipedia is much higher profile than Wikitruth. The Google ranking of Wikipedia articles indicates that. Also, each time that office was used, it was at the behest of our general counsel, who deemed the content potentially dangerous for Wikipedia. As I have stated several times, I did not make WP:OFFICE decisions. I followed the instructions that were given to me by the Foundation's lawyers. [[User:Danny|Danny]] 14:39, 9 April 2007 (UTC)

****I think you are mistaken, [[User:Just H|Just H]]. RFA/B's are requests for the community to demonstrate whether or not the editor has [[User:Avraham/RfA-B|its (the community's) trust]].

* If things continue as Í think they will, this may be a good example for others that, once you become respected by the community and showed at least as much respect towards Wikipedia, you really need to mess everything bad, too bad, to lose that respect.

**What's wrong with his replies?  Responses to these questions are used to gauge how knowledgeable of and dedicated to Wikipedia someone is.

I think his response to question 3, which is forged in bucketfuls of real world experience, is the most refreshingly honest and insightful answer I've ever seen.  --[[User:Cyde|<font color="#ff66ff">'''Cyde Weys'''</font>]] 03:31, 3 April 2007 (UTC)
"How does this help Wikipedia?" That is something, without fail, Danny asks in each and every situation. In the few months I watched him work in the office Danny's first concern wasn't what people were saying, or who did what, or getting his face in the media. Danny's focus is on what helps the project most at that moment.

His ideas are always practical and solid. If Danny sees something that might work for Wikipedia as far as acquiring content or getting official endorsements from respected institutions or landing donations ... he will make it happen. He doesn't waste time generating massive discussion pages or disputing minor issues.

Most people help the project either by being contributors or by performing services (working at the office/networking/hardware/legal issues/donations/etc.). Danny is one of the few people that does both. I once watched him spend 12 hours answering phones, meeting with donors, giving projects to idle volunteers, solving travel problems, and a few other things I can't remember. He then went home and translated four Wikipedia pages into Hebrew.

Danny Wool is one of the project's greatest allies, and it would only suffer without his help administrating it.

'''Danny's supplemental statement'''
</includeonly>

Rather than answer all the remaining questions, I think that I will simply make a statement here. It may lose me votes, and I am fine with that. I asked to go through this process, and I intend to go through this process, even if the result is that I lose. 

I've worn many different hats on the English Wikipedia. I have been a long-time contributor, an admin when adminship was still an appointed position, a bureaucrat, a steward, and even a member of the office staff—the only person entrusted with the dreaded [[WP:OFFICE]]. I have worked behind the scenes in ways that most people can't imagine, and handled complaints from irate people, famous and non-famous and infamous, in a respectful and courteous manner. In most cases, I have even been able to calm them down, though inevitably there were some who did not get what they want. Such is life. 

I have dealt with the community on a professional and courteous level. No, I did not. I went beyond that. Just last night, I had the police in my house because there was a concern about a user's safety. It was not the first time I dealt with an issue like that, and for those who have been around long enough, it will probably not be the last. Suffice it to say that I had no idea who that user was—or is, but still I was ready to help—without making any value judgments.

I have risen just about as high as you can get in the Wikipedia hierarchy, and have been involved in some of the most contentious issues, whether visible to the community or not. I believe in openness. In fact, I would like to see even greater openness in many of our processes. On the other hand, that does not mean that I think everything should be an open book. We all agree that we should protect the right to privacy of our users, even if it means that sometimes people take advantage of our goodwill. Well, there are some other things that require privacy too, whether for personal reasons or for the well-being of the Foundation. In some way, I was charged with protecting that, and I will continue to do so, even now that I no longer work for the Foundation.

As for this RfA, I may have done something unprecedented here. I may have actually told the truth in all of my answers. As a writer, I could have come up with just the right answers. As a long time theology student, I could have painted myself as a penitent or martyr. I could have said all the "right things," but I chose not to. I chose to say it as I see it. As someone who has risen quite nearly to the pinnacle, I believe I have a fairly comprehensive view of the project, its aims, and the means of achieving them. And I believe that honesty, even if it is not always comfortable in the short term, is always the best policy. 

So let me say it as I see it. 

# I believe that Wikipedia is an encyclopedia: This is first and foremost. The question we should ask ourselves is how does this benefit an encyclopedia. When I spoke to the owner of a laundromat, who wanted a page about his business on Wikipedia, I asked him what other encyclopedias he was approaching? Britannica? World Book? Columbia? I asked the same thing of Fleshlight, and was told that they thought of Wikipedia not as an encyclopedia but as a marketing tool. They did not understand.
# I believe that Wikipedia is revolutionary: We are reconfiguring how knowledge is transmitted, and many people don't like that. It is in their interest to show how this new model will fail, even if it means telling students to vandalize Wikipedia to show how bad it is. 
# I believe that Wikipedia is of enormous commercial and advertising value: A page on Wikipedia is worth enormous amounts of money, and a positive review of a product or company or person is too. Of course, we do not do reviews—that is POV-pushing. But maybe, people think to themselves, we can do it subtly, so that no one will notice. Maybe we can convince people to support us. The fact is, they have, and that is unfortunate. It not only rips at the heart of the community by dividing it into factions. It also calls our credibility into question. People already ask, "So how do I know someone didn’t put that in just to promote themselves?"
# I believe that Wikipedia is anarchic: People can do what they want. People are encouraged to do what they want, and yet we have found out that in such a large community that does not always work. That is why there are so many rules, even though when I joined Wikipedia there were only three, and we say that all our rules can be boiled down to the Five Pillars. And yet, people have found ways of gaming the rules, and making new rules to avoid that only makes the existing rule system about as convoluted as this sentence. That is why I believe that the most pertinent rule of all is Common Sense.
# I believe that Wikipedia is not a democracy. Certain goals and principles are not up for negotiations and votes. If 50 percent of the community were to decide that we no longer insist on free content or that unsourced libel about living people is acceptable, we would not change our values. If the Foundation, as represented by the Board and General Counsel, determines that something endangers the very being of the project, it is not negotiable either.
# I believe that Wikipedia is vulnerable: Yes, and Seigenthaler and Porchesia and countless other examples have shown that. I believe in the principle of Assume Good Faith. In fact, I believe in it so much that I refuse to write it out as [[WP:AGF]] and declare it a policy. It is not a policy. It is a lofty sentiment and something we should all strive for. Of course, it does not mean that when someone does us harm, we should at once assume good faith. If someone gropes you in a bar and you turn around and smack them, they have no recourse to [[WP:AGF]]. If someone makes an effort to work against our goals, they should have no recourse to it either.
# I believe that Wikipedia can be the best informational resource in all of human history: And that, and that alone, is what we should be striving for.

That is what I believe, and will continue to believe. I have made mistakes, but have been corrected. I challenge anyone to show me someone who hasn't made mistakes. I realize that this very statement during a contentious RfA may be a mistake, and that I may lose votes because of it, but I am willing to make it anyways. That is because I am not willing to compromise my beliefs, which include an essential belief in the importance of Wikipedia and the basic goodness of its community.

#'''Support''' - After initially seeming likely to set new records for overwhelming support this nom is now trending fail. In reference to the oppose reasons; I find Danny's standing for RFA despite not having to a very '''good''' thing, his answers to the questions were short but direct - and it isn't like I can't tell who Danny is without more info, I'm curious about his reasons for stepping down but see no reason I must have that information, and while I strongly agree that clear edit summaries are important to explain actions I understand a failure to adapt to them and accept his intent to do so going forward. I have a bigger problem with the ''severity'' of many actions Danny has taken in the past (e.g. a month long block with little/no warning) but in most cases not the 'general premise' behind them. For instance, spam is bad, most spammers won't stop just because we ask them to, but we should '''try''' to just talk them down first - because the extra effort required is more than offset by the benefits of the very few who DO 'get it' after discussion. I'd like to see Danny do some things differently, but he has been a great contributor and I don't see any reason to assume that he '''won't''' be willing to take these issues into account. --[[User talk:CBDunkerson|CBD]] 12:30, 5 April 2007 (UTC)

#::Ay, there's the rub, and it goes far beyond Danny. In my mind the encyclopedia will hardly be less credible if we generally AGF, and revert and warn clueless newbies a couple of times before we conclude they're worthless trolls, but it will erode in quality if the attitude of "my way or the highway" continues to grow. The diehard spammer or special interest group will find a way around having their account unceremoniously blocked for a month; the newbie testing the waters with a slightly inappropriate edit will not, and the impact on the atmosphere of having too many admins who feel entitled (with the best possible intentions) to behave in this way will increase burn-out rate amongst worthwhile contributors as that attitude makes its way into broader community interactions. [[User:Martinp|Martinp]] 21:28, 6 April 2007 (UTC)
#:::Recalcitrant spammers need to stopped, there is no question, but if Danny blocks {{user|StringsMan}} for six months without warning or notification why we discourage autobiographies ({{la|Stringsman}}) this is far outside the bounds of the approach we take with first-time editors who add unwanted content. I get the impression that most supporters didn't bother to look at Danny's block log in detail. There is a pretty strong disconnect between long-time contributors who have internalized the policies and the general public who pretty much has no inkling how Wikipedia operates, and Danny's approach personifies this disconnect. ~ [[User:Trialsanderrors|trialsanderrors]] 23:10, 6 April 2007 (UTC)

Maybe, but if they are then I bet that they'd stop after a friendly warning (test1/2).

You still seem to be unaware that ''there was no communication'' from Danny to any of the one-time offenders before or after he blocked them. Here is the whole extent of the exchange:
#:::::*16:08, November 23, 2006 StringsMan creates "Stringsman"
#:::::*16:08, November 23, 2006 Danny deletes "Stringsman"
#:::::*16:11, November 23, 2006 StringsMan creates "Stringsman"

#:''Sad'' is one word for it. I have another word for my feelings about it: out-and-out ''disgusted''. It's clearly all about power here. We have supporters stating that he has demonstrated he can handle the tools, that they trust Danny not to misuse the tools, yet it's clear (from the above and from many other provided examples) ''that he already has misused them, and has (from his statements) absolutely no qualms about doing so again.'' Despite the glaring presence of more than 50 comments in opposition, I suspect that the talk page pundits here are right: he's just gonna get approved (it's all about power), and to hell with us, to hell with WP precepts, etc. I hope I'm proved wrong, but it doesn't look like it's headed that way from where I sit.

#::You know what's sad? The fact that most admins who have to step down/get desysoped have almost no chance of getting the bit through RFA again. Why?

I expect that if re-elected he'll be at least as helpful as the average admin.

#:  I generally agree with [[User:Sjakkalle|the other Sj]] on most things, but here not.  Adminship is no big deal.  It cetainly doesn't need to be an elaborate personality test -- or oine with an ever-increasing barrier to entry.  It seems to me that much of the talk around this nom misses the point, trying to address larger-scale issues of how to be a welcoming and productive community, or how to handle disputes, within the context of an RFA (not terribly productive, as discussion rather than editing a page describing issues for the future, since this format is only vaguely collaborative).  We ''all'' partake in this -- edit wars, mediation, greeting or biting newcomers -- these are not activities done specially by admins.  We shouldn't cultivate the image that admins are somehow the 'best' arbiters of what Wikipedia should be about or what it should contain, or holding them to a higher moral standard than other editors -- admins implement a tiny fraction of policies that it was once troublesome to let everyone carry out... they do not set policy or wield other arcane power, and are as varied and as quirky as the broader pool of well-meaning editors.

'''Oppose'''
</includeonly>
:: <strike>'''Oppose'''.</strike> I am very well aware of the immense amount of good work Danny has done for the project, both as an editor and in his position at WP:OFFICE. I did not agree with some of his promotions as a bureaucrat, but those were not big things and not relevant now. I regretfully have to oppose however per Danny's low usage of edit summaries, currently at 25% for major edits and 49% for minor edits. Yes I know that more edit summaries don't make a better admin, and I am fully aware that Danny has been a very busy guy at WP:OFFICE. However, the fact stands that edit summaries help others understand what you changed. Edit summaries are way of showing  curtsey to other editors and a sign that you care about their time no less than about your own time. Danny will pass with or without my vote, and he fully deserves that. However, hereby I would like to ask Danny to use more edit summaries when he contributes. I will gladly remove my vote should Danny mention that he will try that, and/or if he changes his preferences so that he is warned when an edit is submitted without a summary. Thank you.

However I feel that there are a number of situations where Danny plunged right into controversial and unilateral actions, and where the controversy was ''not'' related to OFFICE and were perfectly avoidable. His actions over [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&type=delete&user=&page=Israel+News+Agency Israel News Agency], where he made a ''second'' unilateral deletion after it had been legitimately undeleted following a full, and long DRV discussion constitutes wheel-warring in my opinion (and the deletion summary "this is tiresome" is just useless). In related matters, although that is a bureaucrat decision, he promoted Sean Black's adminship with considerably less than normal support, ignoring the opposers and substituting his own judgment for the consensus requirement. He supported Essjay for bureaucratship and decided to promote himself when the consensus was in the "discretion" range. I see that this RFA is passing anyway, but I feel that there are enough questionable actions, and ignorance of consensus and discussion, made with the admin tools which cannot be excused with OFFICE duties.

#:Regarding the Israel News Agency: there was ''significant'' offline wrangling over that that you were not privy to.  If you knew what actually happened, you wouldn't be faulting Danny over this one.  Coming from someone who knows a bit more about that situation, I'd say that he did an extremely good job of it.  --[[User:Cyde|<font color="#ff66ff">'''Cyde Weys'''</font>]] 12:40, 3 April 2007 (UTC)
#::An important part of adminship is ''communication'', and if there was significant offline wrangling over it, there should have been some information to the community as to why the results of ''two'' DRVs and ''two'' AFDs were set aside with apparently ''no'' discussion. Saying, "I am deleting this, I have reasons for this which you don't know of, please trust me" just does not cut it for me. It raises the level confusion, being done by a person in the position Danny had, even more so (what is going on here? Why is this suddenly deleted?). That an eventual third AFD did result in the article being deleted in an open and transparent manner illustrates that there was no need for short-circuiting the discussion here. It could have simply been nominated with a reason ("No sources" is pretty compelling), and it would probably be gone in a week without the confusion. For the record, I am not opposing because I want to be mean, or because I think Danny is a bad person (he is clearly a very dedicated contributor), it is because of my concerns over apparent lack of respect for consensus, unilateralism, and lack of communication when doing so. Danny was perfectly within his rights to not relenquish his adminship, and it would clearly have been justified for him to simply request return of sysop tools by simply asking a bureaucrat. When he ''did'' choose to ask for input at RFA, a very admirable decision, then he did accept the possibility of some opposition, right?

The proper course of action would have been to remove all the advert content, leaving it a stub if need be, and if you were really unhappy about the article then you should have put it to an AfD vote. This was not a case of vandalism, and the topic itself was not nonsense. This was a clear case of you deleting something unilaterally because you didn't think it was worth talking about. I get that sort of editing from my father's copy of britanica thank you, I don't find it all that useful. Remember one of the biggest things that makes this project great is that the community gets to deside what is worthy of discussing. A good example was again in the [[Musa Cooper]] case. I agree it probably isnt notable enough to be there. If i were voting on it, i would vote to delete it. but as you can see from the AfD log after it was restored then put to a vote, i (and you) would have been overruled by the community.

#'''Oppose''' - '''(1)''' Lack of edit summaries is not a reason to oppose, but Danny's answer Q4.C. "far too much emphasis is being placed on the way an edit is made than on the quality of the contribution" shows a lack of respect for the [[wp:consensus|consensus]] that brought us the important edit summary guidelines and a lack of understanding of the importance of using edit summaries as part of being [[wp:civil|civil]]. '''(2)''' A second, independent reason to oppose is trust.  It is acceptable that you relinquished positions of trust along with resigning from WMF with out explaining. However, without knowing why you relinquished and resigned your positions, there is not enough information to judge whether you are a trusted user.  Relinquished positions of trust along with resigning from WMF are very significant Wikipedia events for which full disclosure is required to put you back into a position of trust. You can be an editor with secret resignation reasons, but RfA's trust requirement does not permit you to have it both ways.  '''(3)''' Failure to provide sufficient answers to the questions is reason enough to oppose all on its own.  This tells me that when newcomers come to you for answers for an administrative action you took against them, it is unlikely that you will provide them the answers they need to understand your decision so that they will continue on their bad behavior to the disruption of Wikipedia.  It shows a lack of respect for this RfA process and those who went through it.  Alkivar's observation of the attitude "I'm Danny. I don't really need to go through this process" does come across in this very RfA and is not a basis to support a request for adminship.  If you are tired, worn-out, and fed-up, consider taking a wikibreak. '''(4)''' Admins are "[[Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship#About_RfA|trusted users who understand policy.]]" It appears that you use your well-developed reputation as a justification to yourself to avoid complying with policy and other process.  You have used significant authority over others for so long that it appears that your skill in cultivating trust in others without that authority has diminished.  Even if you understand policy, I am not convinced that you will comply with it or defer your judgment to the judgment of the consensus to the level that other admins do.  Your significant Wikipedia experiences seem to work against you, as you seem to have become too jaded to become an administrator.

#<s>'''Neutral'''.</s> I decided to pretend that this was not a foregone conclusion and actually research the candidate's contributions a bit. Unfortunately, what I found is ambiguous. 98% of his work is just great, adding entries to wikisource, free images, and the like, and there is a lot of that good work. Unfortunately, among that good work, there are a number of nitpicks, that don't disqualify, but are hardly model editor level either. [http://tools.wikimedia.de/~mathbot/cgi-bin/wp/rfa/edit_summary.cgi?user=Danny&lang=en Edit summary usage: 26% for major edits and 50% for minor edits.] That's not very good. [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Adam_Cayton-Holland&diff=119516941&oldid=118751522 Here] he removes a {{tl|wikify}} tag without really [[WP:WIKIFY|wikifying]] the article - he wiki-linked one word, but didn't fix the (sole) section heading, and frankly, left the article a rather pitiful stub with bad references and [[WP:BLP]] concerns (uncited clearly controversial statements). [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ikkanda_Warrier&diff=118998407&oldid=118998171 Here] he removes an unformatted external link from an article, leaving the article with no references whatsoever. The link should probably have read http://www.edakkunnitemple.org/html/wariam.html#ikkandawarrier but rather than spend a few minutes looking for that, and making the article a [[WP:STUB|noticeably better stub]], he just deleted. Why? Don't know, no edit summary in either case. [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Wgellstone&diff=next&oldid=93156852 Here] he blocks a new user ''for a month'' for adding two external links to an article, without warnings. Now, sure, probably it wasn't a productive contributor. But was it really a hardened spammer that kept vandalizing after multiple warnings? What happened to blocks being [[WP:BLOCK|preventative and not punitive]]? Heck, what happened to [[Wikipedia:Please do not bite the newcomers]]? On the other hand, as everyone writes above, he has been through the fires of hell with [[WP:OFFICE]], no doubt that has made him a bit rough around the edges. Anyway, maybe this will help someone else decide. It didn't help me enough. Now I'll go and clean up the issues I found. --[[User:AnonEMouse|AnonEMouse]] <sup>[[User_talk:AnonEMouse|(squeak)]]</sup> 19:44, 3 April 2007 (UTC)
#:Changing to '''Oppose''', and I'm very sorry, because Danny has been admirably honest in stating his views. "In cases of spam or obvious bad intent, I will continue to bite." Yes, [[Fleshlight]] wanted their article to be an ad - that didn't mean we shouldn't have had an article, it just shouldn't have been an ad. It should have been stubbed down from an ad, and eventually made NPOV, which is what happened. We shouldn't delete articles "in revenge" for the bad intentions or behaviour of the article subject, those should be irrelevant (or we'd hardly have an article on [[Charles Manson]], would we?). [[Arch Coal]] is another example that started as spam: an ad, explicitly written for pay by [[MyWikiBiz]], but clearly notable. It was stubbed down, then improved to NPOV. [[Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Darthgriz98 |Just a few sections below]] is the RfA of someone who started here with "[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=George_W._Bush&diff=prev&oldid=29980693 obvious bad intent]", far worse than adding two inappropriate links; had she been blocked for a month without warning after that first vandalism edit, would she be standing for RfA now?

#'''Reluctant oppose'''. There is no question that Danny has done a lot of outstanding work for the encyclopedia. Also, I think he has earned the trust to have have noncontroversially remained a janitor after resigning his Foundation positions had he chosen to do so, becoming "one of a thousand". But his answers to the nom questions above make it increasingly clear that in choosing to go through RFA, he is saying "take me as I am or vote accordingly". That involves all the issues raised by others above. So this becomes a WP philosophical issue, with Danny's RFA representing the position that Wikipedia is under seige from vandals and spammers and we should just "cut our losses" and chase away whoever appears to be being nonconstructive. While I don't dispute vandalism and spamming is an issue, I think the gradual erosion of civility, AGF, and collaborative effort are longer term a bigger threat to the health of the project. Thus my regretful and reluctant oppose, with a plea to Danny to recognize that if he does get promoted, the fact that his support level is currently running in the 70s rather than the 90s he deserves is a statement about the discomfort a significant part of the community feels as to his stated approach. If he does not get promoted, I would encourage him to apply again at RFA soon if he feels he can reshape his approach to be different, and continue to be a respected and productive Wikipedian in any way he wishes.

#'''Firm oppose''' As Xoloz, I was not particularly pleased with certain of Danny's uses of the admin tools (to say, of course, nothing of his uses of the 'crat tools), and I am not at all sure that I could conclude with any degree of certainty that [[User:Jahiegel/Views on Wikipedia/Requests for adminship|the net effect on the project of his being (re)sysopped should be positive]].  Such concern is exacerbated by the tenor of the answers to several questions, which appear, as Xihr suggests, to evidence an attitude of entitlement the existence of which in a prospective admin is quite inauspicious.  I can surely understand that Danny should feel irked about his being opposed so vociferously by some here, especially because it wasn't as though there was some grand clamor for him to be desysopped whilst he was in the employ of the Foundation (or even, for that matter, any consistent criticism); some of us, though, were not great fans of the fashion in which he used the tools on en.wiki, and I, for one, whilst awed by the breadth of Danny's mainspace and project-space contributions and whilst fond of Danny qua person, found his leaving the WMF&mdash;and his ostensibly returning to the project (exclusively) as an editor&mdash;to be a positive (at least relative en.wiki).

Danny is asking us to take him as he is with apparently little interest in considering whether there are ways he could better satisify the community as a whole.  Even if 75% of the community is will to accept him, that is not a statement that he is without flaws.  Adminship should be about promoting people who are prepared to fulfill the community's needs.

Statements (that I personally view as bordering on arrogant; this is not a personal attack at the nominee, simply a reminder that members of this community that did ''not'' automatically know who Danny was may not share the same reverence when reading these responses) that are excused as "refreshing truth" don't work in an open community when concerns are not addressed.

#'''Oppose''' Flcelloguy's excellent summary in Q22 makes it pretty clear. The only question that really matters at RFA is if the editor is likely to abuse the admin tools. In this case, the editor has ''already abused the tools'' by wheel warring, making rash indef blocks to long term editors in good standing and performing a baseless de-sysoping. No editor is irreplaceable, just as no admin is irreplaceable. Danny may have done a lot of good work, but admin-ship is not an award and as I said no one is irreplaceable...I don't feel very good about this but there it is.

#'''Oppose''' This was by far the most difficult oppose vote I've ever cast on wikipedia. Danny has undoubtedly benefitted wikipedia hugely in the past, but he has also shown a lot of disrespect towards his fellow contributors. He complains about the excessive legalism in wikipedia, and uses that as an explanation for his skirting of consensus and doing things without discussion. Well, it's not really about the legalism, it's about respect. I think humility and deference are two hugely important qualities for an admin to have. I believe that if he was re-instated, the negative effect on wikipedia caused by all the strife his decisions create would be larger than the positive effect of having him as an admin. It's utilitarian, but that's the way I feel. Besides, you don't need to be an admin to be a good wikipedian. I suggest he goes back to the basics and start writing articles and help forming consensus again. --[[User:Oskar Sigvardsson|Oskar]] 22:02, 8 April 2007 (UTC)

When I look at Danny's editing history in the same way that I would look at any other candidate's history, the only possible action is to oppose. As for considering Danny's history in context of his personal circumstances, well, I said it during the [[User:Essjay/RFC#Outside_view_by_Elonka|Essjay controversy]], and I'll say it again here:  Leaders set the tone in a culture. Danny is still a leader here, from his quantity of work, from his tenure at the Wikimedia office, and by sheer "time in service" at Wikipedia. But let's ask ourselves this: Do we think that Danny sets a good example?  Would we want other editors to emulate him? I say no, the tone that Danny wants to set, isn't the one that I want for Wikipedia. For example, if we look at the discussions that have gone into [[WP:BLOCK]] and [[WP:BITE]], the community consensus is clear that we are supposed to be patient with new users: Warn first, block if that doesn't work.  If Danny doesn't agree with that, then the proper way he should deal with the situation is to propose a change at [[Wikipedia talk:Blocking policy]], not to simply go vigilante. In other words, I support or oppose an admin based not just on whether or not they'd be "good with the mop," but by whether they can set an example of how a good Wikipedian should act. Sure, some people say, "Adminship is no big deal," but it [[Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Giano#Administrator_conduct |''is'' a big deal]]. As soon as someone is identified as an admin in any discussion, they are perceived as an authority figure. Junior editors often closely observe how an admin acts, to learn how ''they'' should act. Now, I ''do'' agree that Danny has done a lot of good things for Wikipedia, and that he has used admin tools with wisdom in the past. But just because someone has been an admin before, doesn't mean that they should be immediately re-sysopped. When someone has provably used admin tools in an irresponsible way, it is ''not'' time to give the tools back to them, unless they can first prove that they can behave in a responsible "Good Wikipedian" way.  Danny just resigned from the Office a few weeks ago, so, I say, give him a few months as a normal editor, to adapt. Let him prove that he still understands the core Wikipedia policies and guidelines (especially WP:BLOCK and WP:BITE), that he's willing to abide by consensus ''even if he disagrees with it,'' that he can treat new editors with civility and patience, and that he's ready to work on building consensus, rather than simply insisting on his own view. Disclaimer: I am one of the editors who Danny has referred to as a spammer[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArticles_for_deletion%2FElonka_Dunin_%282nd_nomination%29&diff=65381752&oldid=65381210][http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Elonka_Dunin_%282nd_nomination%29&oldid=65301274] (a characterization I strongly protest).

#'''Oppose''' per the all-too-public airing of dirty laundry from the Foundation Board's chair.

#'''Oppose'''. With the answers to the basic RfA questions, the low edit summary usage, and the general tendency to bite, most users would not be anywhere near as close to passing RfA as Danny is. I was happy to see that Danny had given longer, more descriptive answers to questions 4-7 after some editors raised these sorts of points, but I can't agree with the contents of those and later answers, either. Danny has done a lot of good work for Wikipedia, but now the question we're faced with is whether the project would be better off with him as an administrator, and I am not confident that the answer to that question is yes. Process is important. [[User:Dekimasu|Dekimasu]]<font color="darkgreen"><small>[[User talk:Dekimasu|よ!]]</small></font> 12:54, 9 April 2007 (UTC)
#'''Oppose''' (switched from support) - I said before that there is no need for this process and I still believe that.  Danny was previously confirmed by the community and gave up his sysop powers of his own accord without controversy so he has every right to have them restored on demand.  That said, I am switching to oppose based on the supplemental statement.  If you believe that all of your fellow admins are lying, then that's a pretty dim view.  You speak of assume good faith having lost its meaning, well, that's what happens when we are unwilling to exercise it. --[[User:BigDT|BigDT]] 13:00, 9 April 2007 (UTC)
#'''Oppose'''. Danny has done good service for the project in many different ways, but I'm troubled by his apparent inclinations toward unilateral action and away from transparency of process. I would be willing to overlook these in most cases, since adminship is supposed to be No Big Deal, but in this instance I think the "aura of authority" from the positions that he's held in the past would make it difficult to call him to account should it become necessary to do so. I think a re-nomination in a few months might have a better chance of success, once he's had a chance to re-establish himself as a civilian. -[[User:Hit bull, win steak|Hit bull, win steak]]<sup>[[User talk:Hit bull, win steak|(Moo!)]]</sup> 13:47, 9 April 2007 (UTC)
#'''Oppose'''. On the positive side, he uses his own name, which will help him in the future, and is more than can be said for 99% of all admins. He clearly has a wealth of experience at a vastly higher level than most ordinary users. He is a titan. But based on his answers here, and his general attitude, I feel he needs to be humble for a few years before officially returning to the bottom rung of the ladder. It will improve his character. He must promise not to perform admin duties by proxy. I am worried that, amongst his fellow admins, he might end up like David Bowie in [[Tin Machine]], or Paul McCartney in [[Wings_(band)|Wings]]. -[[User:Ashley Pomeroy|Ashley Pomeroy]] 13:52, 9 April 2007 (UTC)
#'''Oppose''' - As a Johnny come lately member of the community I have many (as yet to be expressed) opinions about many wikipedia policies. I thank Danny for his overall contributions and participation and consider him a valuable member of the community. Since I am allowed to express a vote and an opinion, I choose to express opposition as a vote in opposition of many of the things Danny stands for as a representative of Wikipedia (which isn't personal - it's more structural). I'd rather see things go in a lot of different directions, and this is one humble mechanism for expressing myself about wikipedia.

#'''Oppose'''.  I realize that Danny has some ambition toward a Board position and this candiacy is nothing more than a stepping stone toward that goal.  As such, he is essentially asking every person here to get political about his disputes with the current board.  Isn't it a shame that Danny wants to be an administrator even though he's never helped bring an article to feature status?  Most folks who contribute to Wikipedia are not admins and that fact should never be used to minimize anyone's contributions.  If Danny truly wants to get the respect of the peiople here, he should try his hand at being a simple editor, toiling in the vioneyards, so to speak.  Given that he has been out of the office and in the less exalted status of simple editor for about a month, let's see how well he handles that position first.

#:Danny absolutely has the best interests of Wikipedia in mind. His views are almost certainly in line with mine and most Wikipedians.  There is obvious evidence of previous tool abuse but I also think he would take to heart these complaints of heavy-handed blocking for simple issues. I entirely disregard any complaints about OFFICE actions as not reflecting on him personally.
#:What I see though, is a little bit of arrogance. Danny should edit without the tools for awhile. Even better, he should edit with a new username. In doing that he should express the same opinions and perform the same actions that he would with the tools. Feel the frustration of seeing a spammer add his links to ten articles and have to beg an administrator to intervene while the spammer then adds his links to one hundred, then waste time fixing those hundred articles by hand. Go ahead and revert en-masse the edits of a rabid POV-pusher, and see if you get blocked or warned by an admin who isn't paying attention to the issue. Go make a few edits to articles where an admin is playing at ownership and see if they threaten you.  Nominate ten obviously stupid articles on the same obvious stupid subject for speedy delete. Then go scan the SD queue and rescue articles.
#:I've watched new users get blocked, even perma-banned, for all of these things when vested users would not. And I've experienced the frustration trying to deal with all sorts of disruption and having to beg an admin to take an interest.  All admins should take time off from having the tools to ''feel'' what it's like without them. Danny's answers and actions show that he doesn't have a sympathetic connection to the majority of editors and has lost touch with what it's like to not have the tools.

#:Danny bit newcomers harder than was necesary as documented above.
#:Danny sort of dismisses his lack of edit sumaries but they ARE important to people trying to figure out which edits to their watch list they should take the time to investigate.  I am glad he has now set the preference to force him to add them, but I think his saying "hard to teach an old dog new tricks" is very worrisome.  It is not like Danny went away for a few years and came back to see things had changed.  He was here all along.  Why didn't he adapt?  That leaves me wondering, what other changes have occurred in the community that Danny has not adapted to. 
#:The answers to several of the questions worry me.  I think the first few replies showed an inclination not to take this seriously.  I am also concerned by the answer to question 20.  Even with his furhter comments on the subject, I am left thinking he is not learning from the criticism here.
#:I think other editors, such as Sjakkalle, Elonka, Badleydrawnjeff, and Rebelguys2 have also given good reason for opposition.

#:::Actually, as pointed out repeatedly, there was ''no communication'' between Danny and the so-called spammers.

#:::Regarding biting newcomers please see the evidence in question 5 as well as the comments by AnonEMouse.
#:::Regarding you statement that " think evidence of a real "newbie biting" problem would be overwhelming if it were true, but I just don't see it."  Great, you don't see it.  You've already made your comment.  Hopefully the beauracrats will consider your comment along with everyone elses.  I didn't come up there and hassel you about your comment.  I do see a problem and I'm commenting on it.
#:::Regarding edit summaries, you are not taking into account my whole comment.  My whole comment includes the concern about wondering how he missed that Wikipedia was evolving to consider edit summaries as important.  My whole comment includes the concern that the project has changed in other ways that cannot be fixed by simply checking a box in his preferences.  
#:::I do point out that he replied well to this one criticism, but I don't see him responding well across the board to the criticism that he is getting here.  I pointed out something he did well because I think he should be praised for things he does well, even if I still have concerns over-all.  
#:::Regarding Raul654 - if he doesn't make good use of edit summaries, then he should start doing so.

#Reluctantly, and after several internal flip-flops.  (Including via neutral, so perhaps that's flip-flop-flaps, or something.)  I saw no pressing need for Danny to resign as an admin (though frankly, he couldn't have de-BC'd fast enough for my tastes), and despite some concerns on timing, I was initially inclined to support, on all the obvious grounds.  But given the strength of feelings raised, I think it would be highly preferable to revisit the matter after a couple of months of "waiting for the dust to settle", per several other commentators.

#'''Oppose'''. Danny's attitude as revealed by the diffs provided in this RfA and even by his own responses here leaves me unable to trust him with admin tools.

#'''Reluctant Oppose''' - while Danny's clearly been a major contributor to Wikipedia, and I'm relatively new to the project, I find the block log and attitude toward [[WP:BITE]] exceedingly troubling, as per AnonEMouse, trialsanderrors, and others above. As a newer user myself, I can appreciate that newbies may not be aware of the particulars of Wikipedia policy, and believe it to be far more constructive to warn rather than block for a first, limited offense.  On the other hand, I recognize that adminship (to say nothing of Office) brings stress and controversy with it, hence my reluctance and willingness to reconsider pending further discussion and information.

#'''Conflicted neutral'''.  Danny has done a tremendous amount of good for Wikipedia, and I would generally argue that his merits (a keen focus on the encyclopedia's mission, an excellent history of service to Wikipedia) outweigh his demerits (the tendency to block and bite without warning, the occasional lack of respect for consensus, etc.).  But the thing which prevents me from voting "support" is his stubborn refusal to acknowledge that those who criticize his ''style'' as detrimental to his stated aims have a legitimate point.  If I saw a hint that if resysopped, Danny would try to be more patient with newbies, or would take more care to explain his decisions when possible, it would be enough to sway me towards support.  But there is an obstinacy in Danny's answers which troubles me deeply.  Danny acknowledges that he has made mistakes, but he shows no evidence of changing the elements of his style which led to those mistakes.  Without that evidence, I can't support his readminship. —[[User:Josiah Rowe|Josiah Rowe]] <small>([[User talk:Josiah Rowe|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Josiah Rowe|contribs]])</small> 09:42, 8 April 2007 (UTC)

'''Comment'''
*As far as I am concerned, Danny's reasons for resigning have absolutely nothing to do with his suitability to be an admin on the projects. I'm tired of seeing the swirls of speculation about this and whether there was some sinister backstory; whether he chooses to share his motivation at some point or another really has no bearing on whether he would (continue to) be an asset to the project by having the admin tools.

**Yes, as I mentioned above the demands for an explanation sound a bit like Number 2 in ''[[The Prisoner]]'': "Why did you resign?"
