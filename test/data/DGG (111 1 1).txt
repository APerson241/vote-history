'''Final (111/1/1); Ended Tues, 9 May 2007 02:18 UTC'''

{{User|DGG}} - DGG a.k.a. David Goodman is one of the most knowledgable Wikipedians I have come across. I first came across him when I was closing some AfD discussions, and I have found he has always put forward his arguments in a clear, consistent and correct manner - I've been very impressed. He certainly knows our policies and guidelines, and I can imagine him to be a frequent AfD closer if promoted. With regards to writing, he is often found adding references on various topics, and expanding various articles. He is just the kind of person this site needs as an administrator &ndash; I hope the community can agree with me.

:''Candidate, please indicate acceptance of the nomination here:'' Yes, I accept. '''[[User:DGG|DGG]]''' 01:46, 2 May 2007 (UTC)
<!--The candidate may make an optional statement here-->
For my general views on wikipedia, please see my [[User:DGG|user page]], an essay about [[User:DGG/my_view_of_WP|my view of WP]], written when I was new here and adjusted a little since, and a discussion inspired by some editing [[User:DGG/controversy|controversies]].

====Questions for the candidate====
Dear candidate, thank you for offering to serve Wikipedia as an administrator. You may wish to answer the following <u>optional</u> questions to provide guidance for participants:

:'''1.''' What admin work do you intend to take part in?
::'''A:''' My main concerns in wikipedia are getting unsatisfactory but rescuable pages improved to keepable status, getting new users started writing good pages, and trying to establish consistency in article deletion decisions.  When I check [[CAT:CSD]] and elsewhere to search for pages need rescuing, I necessarily see much larger numbers of utterly worthless or even harmful articles that should be deleted, and it would be very useful to be able to delete them as I went along.  When helping new users with deleted pages, it is useful to be able help them in detail, by seeing just what was wrong with the page, and being able to undelete for the purpose. When commenting at AfD and Deletion Review, I occasionally need to check the nature of a deleted article in order to comment intelligently, and it would help if I did not have to ask others for this.  
:: I would also  be able to close XfDs, though I do not intend to close any discussion in which I have also debated. And of course I come upon vandals, and the sooner action is taken the better.

:'''2.''' What are your best contributions to Wikipedia, and why?
::'''A:''' My most successful contributions to specific articles has been improving and maintaining the pages on Gutenberg and related topics. There are very strong  positions taken there about whether his inventions certainly had an Asian origin, or certainly did not, and it requires continual intervention to keep a balance, since there is no positive evidence and reputable authorities on each side.   

:: My most successful rescues from speedy deletion has been  [[Brown Girl, Brownstones]], a famous pioneering children's book, and [[740 Park Avenue]], the 2nd most famous NYC apartment house. I spotted them, but of course others helped.

:: At AfD, I think I have been instrumental in helping establish the idea that full professors at major universities are almost certain notable, and assistant professors usually not. And also establishing the more frequently needed idea that most elementary schools are not notable, and should be combined in the school district, that high schools usually are notable if sourced carefully enough, and that middle schools vary. 

:: I also have a variety of specialized databases conveniently available, and I am often able to help at AfD by finding esoteric references. But some of my successes have simply been with Google, using patience and actually looking at the results--see [[Aluka]]. 

:'''3.''' Have you been in any conflicts over editing in the past or have other users caused you stress? How have you dealt with it and how will you deal with it in the future?
:: '''A:''' I have engaged in many of debates at AfD, and generally not everyone usually agrees with me, with some feeling strongly about it. I try not to be personal, but its easy to misinterpret an argument. This happened with  Lotusduck once, but I think we understand each other now. I sometime respond to RfCs, and try to mediate. It's inevitable that both sides get angry during this, or the RfC wouldn't have been needed. I once had a unpleasant back and forth with The Jade Knight over the relative size  of some libraries; I entered a neutral edit and disengaged; eventually someone else came along and made the appropriate good edit. I just had an exchange with about public domain sources with Coren, but we're on the way to understanding here as well. 

:: But I have never gotten a serious warning, come close to 3RR, or been threatened with a block. I hope to continue that way, even as an admin. I've been active removing spam links, but I've managed to keep them out by persistence, not conflict. Rapid action, repeated as needed, can repress most troublemakers. 

:: I cope personally with situations that threaten to become emotional by dealing with many different things, not concentrating on a single subject. I avoid editing in a few things I deeply care about that would threaten my ability to be objective. I compromise everything that can be compromised. And if anyone even thinks I have done something inappropriate, I apologize.  When I make the inevitable errors, I hope people will continue to tell me.  

:'''4.''' To anticipate:   Under what circumstances should one [[WP:IAR| ignore all rules]]?  
:: '''A:''' Almost always, there can be a satisfactory resolution or compromise within the existing rules. Most of the operating rules are guidelines permitting flexible interpretations, and a great deal depends on the choice of rule and the interpretation.  In my experience so far, I have not come across a situation where the appropriate use of one or another of the policies or guidelines would not meet the situation--where it would have been impossible to keep a worthy article  or edit or remove a bad one within the existing rules.  But it's important to have IAR established as a possibility in case it is needed. 

:: I have rarely seen an editing dispute that cannot be settled by compromise, and there are many ways to do compromises. If one party is not acting in good faith, then the way is to try to find supporters and hold fast. If there are two opposing parties neither of which seem to be in good faith, then the way is to propose compromises in order to make it clear that there are potential compromises and that it would benefit everyone to try for one. If the topic also is interesting to other sensible people, they'll help. If the people at  each other's throats are the only ones who really care, then there may be no solution in a wiki, and I do not see how IAR will help.  I've been involved in one such, when I responded to the RfC on Gordon James Klingenschmitt; I think I succeeded, but I didn't want to stay forever; the various parties destroyed the article after I left, and it was eventually  [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Gordon James Klingenschmitt | deleted.]]

:'''5.''' (Optional question from [[User:Mangojuice|Mango]][[Special:Contributions/Mangojuice|<span style="color:orange">'''juice'''</span>]]<sup>[[User talk:Mangojuice|talk]]</sup>)  Suppose you looking around for XfD debates to close and you come across one that has, say 6 favoring deletion and 2 favoring keeping, and you think the article is rescuable from the unsourced/nn/possibly promotional state it is currently in.  Under what circumstances would you not close the debate as a delete?

::'''A:''' I would evaluate the arguments raised. If most of the 6 delete arguments showed careful consideration of the possible notability and chance of improvement, and the 2 favoring keeping had no strong argument otherwise, then I would assume my opinion was aberrant and I would close for deletion, and suggest the possibility of re-creation in the close. Otherwise, I would add my opinion to the discussion, and let someone else close. I would not close as a keep or no consensus; even if all 6 of the delete arguments were nonsense, which is not likely, it would be fairer to add my voice as a debater.  I think it totally wrong to close debates to favor one's own argument, no matter how strong one thinks the argument: someone else should evaluate it.  (Does this mean I will not close debates on academics or elementary schools unless opinion is essentially unanimous: yes, it does, I would not close any debate where my own opinion might conceivably influence the close. There's quite enough other ones needing closure.)'''[[User:DGG|DGG]]''' 22:52, 2 May 2007 (UTC)
:::Jumping into someone else's conversation here - but I don't think DGG's as much of an inclusionist as he's painted. Yes, he sometimes is the sole voice saying keep, but sometimes so am I; I've never seen him saying keep without a legitimate reason (even if I don't always think it's valid). And he can be as ruthless a deleter as anyone if he doesn't see a valid reason to keep - just ask [[Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive228#Harassment_charges_against_dhartung_and_iridescenti|Billy Hathorn]] if he'd consider him an inclusionist...<font face="Trebuchet MS"> —  [[User:Iridescenti|<font color="orangered">'''irides'''</font><font color="darkviolet">'''centi'''</font>]] [[User_talk:Iridescenti|<small><font color="chocolate"><i>(talk to me!)</i></font></small>]]</font> 23:09, 2 May 2007 (UTC)

:'''6'''. "Editors should remove any contentious material about living persons that is unsourced [or poorly sourced]... Editors who re-insert the material may be warned and blocked" (from [[WP:BLP]]). How rigorously would you enforce BLP policy?--[[User talk:Doc glasgow|Doc]]<sup>g</sup> 10:07, 3 May 2007 (UTC)
::'''A:''' I noticed there is a proposal to change "contentious" to "negative," which is a change I would support. The principle is right; the rigor of enforcement depends on the actual sourcing, and the nature of the content. I have always supported deleting articles whose main point is to  make accusations of serious crime that have not yet been legally proven, or based on trivial misdemeanors of private individuals that have nonetheless attracted some public attention. For all information involving opinion or accusation, I prefer to rely on direct sourced quotes, not rewritings by WP editors, which run the risk of introducing our own opinions. '''[[User:DGG|DGG]]''' 17:01, 3 May 2007 (UTC)

:'''7'''. In closing an Afd of a low-notability biography, if it appears that the subject has requested deletion, what weight would you give this information?--[[User talk:Doc glasgow|Doc]]<sup>g</sup> 10:07, 3 May 2007 (UTC)
::'''A:''' Once more, this depends upon the detailed circumstances. If it is a matter of genuine public interest, and the material is fairly reported, I think the biography should generally stay. But if the notabilty is really borderline, then  this consideration can reasonably affect the final balance. '''[[User:DGG|DGG]]''' 17:01, 3 May 2007 (UTC)

:'''8'''. What do you consider to be your weak points in your Wikipedia editing skills and general behavior on the site? - [[User:MacGyverMagic|Mgm]]|[[User talk:MacGyverMagic|<sup>(talk)</sup>]] 22:35, 5 May 2007 (UTC)
::'''A:''' The one that most embarrasses me  is the frequency in which I make typing or formatting errors. I am now fairly scrupulous about using a spelling checker, but I need to find or devise a program to take care of other problems--in the absence of one, I obviously must use the preview button a good deal more. Many my minor edits are ones going back and correcting my own work. This is especially important as an admin if I'm making a critical comment or trying to repress a vandal: it thoroughly weakens the effect to have it sloppy. Now that I've publicly confessed it, maybe I('ve shamed myself into watch out properly. 

:'''9'''. Your views on WP page lists some things where you appear to disagree with current practice. If you had to pick one thing to change right now, what would it be and how would you change it? (P.S. The "some say" bit you mentioned in there, may be used, but it's actually weasel wording which policy/guidelines say should be avoided). - [[User:MacGyverMagic|Mgm]]|[[User talk:MacGyverMagic|<sup>(talk)</sup>]] 22:35, 5 May 2007 (UTC)
::'''A:''' As mentioned there, the essay was written in early days here. I'm still troubled by the way major POV differences are handled, but, I'm not at all sure I know a solution. Broad issues are difficult to summarize briefly. But there are two related  procedural changes I would make:
:::First, not permit repeated nominations for AfD until a reasonable interval: I think it would greatly encourage meaningful compromise. 
:::Second, have a "3CC" rule limiting anyone to 3 comments a day in any particular discussion. I think this would greatly decrease the number and bitterness of arguments, and reduce the work at ArbCom, RfC, and ANI. If you can't say what you mean in three tries, you should wait till another day. 
:: The way  I would accomplish change is to suggest these from time to time when it seems appropriate, but certainly not  bring  these up continually or nag about them. I hope that the merits would appeal to at least the newcomers who  might share the experience that no other organized body in the world operates without some form of closure and some limits to debate. WP shouldn't be Slashdot. At Slashdot all that's wanted is talk, but here we need work. 
::I am aware that I am probably in the minority on both of these--and perhaps a small minority--but I want to give an honest answer here even if not politic.  '''[[User:DGG|DGG]]''' 00:26, 6 May 2007 (UTC)

:'''10. Optional question by <i><b>[[User:Snowolf|<font color = "darkmagenta">Snowolf</font>]]<small> <sup>[[User_talk:Snowolf|(talk)]]</sup> <sub>[[WP:CON|CON]]</sub> <sup>[[WP:COI|COI]]</sup></small></b> - </i>: Is your password alphanumeric? Formed by at least 8 characters? Not by words in the dictionary? Not in the [http://geodsoft.com/howto/password/common.htm weakest password list]? (just answer ''yes'' plz)'''
::'''A:'''::
It meets the requirements of being secure to a greater degree than those mentioned.  I have been following (and joining) the discussion of this on WP:SECURITY, WP:ADMIN and on the wikien-l list  and I see there is no agreement yet on just what the requirement should be and how it should be worded, though there certainly is agreement on a requirement--as there should have been all along.

He never said that Google Maps was a secondary source at all.  That's really a misleading claim.  It's clear he was referencing the secondary sources ''about'' google maps, presumably the BBC article, ABC news and other good sources.

AFD works best when people treat it as a discussion, and thus comment until they feel they've fully expressed their opinion and everyone understands who's willing to understand. Just incidentally I've seen several AFDs where people have challenged or questioned your comments and you made no reply. I don't really think this is the best way to go about AFD, but obviously I have about the exact opposite approach, routinely turning AFDs into very out-dented streams of discussion, but that's what I think AFD is about.
