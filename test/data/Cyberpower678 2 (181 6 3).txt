====Nomination====
{{User|Cyberpower678}}&nbsp;– I would like to present Cyberpower as a candidate for adminship.  Cyberpower has been here since mid-2011 and focuses his work on the technical aspects of Wikipedia - specialising in bot work and developing tools that make everything run more smoothly around here. He also helps out new users at [[WP:ACC]] and - demonstrating a high level of trust - holds the '''global renamer''' right on meta, performing user renames (previously a task reserved to bureaucrats before accounts were unified globally). His interactions with other editors, including new users still getting to grips with how Wikipedia works, show good communication skills and the sort of patience that admins often need. Cyberpower has also demonstrated the kind of analysis of consensus expected of admins over numerous RfC closes.

As some of you may remember, this is not Cyberpower's first RfA.  He ran previously in [[Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Cyberpower678|July 2015]], leading to a razor close result that required a [[Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Cyberpower678/Bureaucrat discussion|bureaucrat discussion]]. Cyberpower withdrew with the participating bureaucrats split as to whether or not there was a consensus for promotion. I didn't think he was quite there 18 months ago, but I have no such reservations now and think that an RfA from him is if anything overdue. 

Cyberpower has done great work since his previous RfA and addressed many of the concerns raised previously. Something that Cyberpower has not done - and I don't fault him for it - is radically changed the way in which he contributes to Wikipedia (which would have been necessary for him to address the rest of the opposing comments). Cyberpower remains someone who enjoys the technical and process side of the project. His chief contribution to the project therefore remains on the technical side, through bots and tools which that take of many repetitive tasks we rarely think about (and are glad don't need to trouble human editors who have better things to do). I am conscious that this means that Cyberpower doesn't fit the mold of some people's ideal admin candidate. I would say however that I believe that our admin pool is made stronger by reflecting the diversity of the interests and editing patterns of our contributors, and we should keep that in mind when evaluating candidates. Balance is a good thing - we shouldn't be looking for an identikit admin corps.

I believe that Cyberpower would make an excellent addition to the admin team. He has shown that he can be relied upon to think carefully before using the tools, to explain his decisions clearly and to ask for help when in doubt - those are for me the most important characteristics of a good admin. <strong style="font-variant:small-caps">[[User:WJBscribe|WJBscribe]] [[User talk:WJBscribe|(talk)]]</strong> 21:44, 3 January 2017 (UTC)

====Co-nomination====
I was delighted to hear that Cyberpower was going to run for RfA and immediately volunteered to co-nominate him. WJBscribe has done an excellent job of describing his qualifications, so I would like to speak to Cyberpower's personal qualities. I admire him for his technical skill, as I think we all do. He not only writes useful cyber-assistants for us; he also maintains and fixes a huge number of programs written by other people. But I also admire him for his positive attitude and level head. His talk page is always filled with people wanting technical advice, and he responds with a competence, patience, and maturity that many of us might envy. He knows what he is good at and knows his limits, and I am confident that will continue to be the case when he has tools. It is sometimes said, in support of a admin candidate, "I trust them not to break the wiki." I would modify that to say that, if someone does break the wiki, I trust Cyberpower to fix it! Seriously, he is a very valuable Wikipedian now, but I believe he would become even more valuable as an admin. --[[User:MelanieN|MelanieN]] ([[User talk:MelanieN|talk]]) 01:21, 4 January 2017 (UTC)

====Co-nomination====
I'm not a fan of multiple nominations but in this case because I was possibly [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?diff=prev&oldid=670633532 largely instrumental for the previous RfA ending in 'non consensus'], I would like to say now that Cyber has matured immensely since the ups and downs of his private life a year ago and the challenge of starting college, and that at his age 18 months can make a huge difference. No, his priority is not in adding content, but in many ways his expertise  might even be just as important. His IT work helps hold the content together and provides indispensable tools that enable us to, well, among other things, assess potential for adminship. He needs admin tools for a lot of that work. It's time now for him to have them and after all the hassle I once gave him, I'm honoured that  he mentioned that he would like me to be a nominator. [[User:Kudpung|Kudpung กุดผึ้ง]] ([[User talk:Kudpung|talk]]) 06:33, 4 January 2017 (UTC)

:''Candidate, please indicate acceptance of the nomination here:'' I would first like to thank my 3 nominators above for putting in their good word in nominating me for adminship, I would also like to thank the other nominators of the other currently running RfAs, for making the effort of recruiting active users, if this can be kept up, it's an important step to fixing the declining admin issue.  I am happy to accept this nomination.

====Questions for the candidate====
Dear candidate, thank you for offering to serve Wikipedia as an administrator. Please answer these questions to provide guidance for participants:
:'''1.''' What administrative work do you intend to take part in?
::'''A:''' My core experience is in renaming, bot work, templates, and ACC.  I'm therefore intending to focus on [[WP:UAA]], [[WP:AIV]], and community approved adminbots, as well as adminbots that need a new maintainer.  I feel that I can confidently be productive there.  It's a simple answer, yes, but I don't intend on using the tools in areas I need to learn in first.  If I ever have an interest in participating in those areas, I would be a participant there first, before I would start acting as an admin.  I have no interest in [[WP:CSD]]s however.

:'''2.''' What are your best contributions to Wikipedia, and why?
::'''A:''' Since my last RfA, I have started the bot project called "InternetArchiveBot".  It's an active project that I continuously work on, some of you may familiar with it.  To those that aren't, the purpose is to build a community bot that goes around Wikipedia to fix the ongoing problems of [[WP:LINKROT]].  It's a really complex project in that it involves being able to handle references formatted in a variety of ways, and properly alter them as to not break them.  It's an ongoing project, and something I will not stop working on until it's "right".  What makes this a community bot is that community can get involved its maintenance using the [[toollabs:iabot|tools I am developing on tool labs]].  Right now users can easily report false positives and modify URL data the bot uses on Wikipedia.  This allows the bot to become even more reliable in the future, helping the bot to understand what works, and what doesn't.  It's an ongoing project, that I'm having lot's of fun doing and I hope the community will see the benefit of this bot in the months to come.
:::Granted this isn't content, I would argue that content creation and bot work have more in common than people often realize.  With content, one writes an article that needs to comply with several policies, and for GAs and FAs must adhere to even stricter standards down to page formatting.  For bots, users write code that must adhere to proper syntax in order, must be pushed through approval, and must have the consensus of the community.  There's the glamour of having ones article live, just as there is the glamour of being able to let a newly written bot run.  There's also the frustration of having the bot code become obsolete and needs to be shut off because consensus has changed, or it's too old and not worth fixing, and that can be compared to the frustration of having an article one wrote get deleted.

:'''3.''' Have you been in any conflicts over editing in the past or have other users caused you stress? How have you dealt with it and how will you deal with it in the future?
::'''A:''' Aside from the recent on and off wiki harassment/death threats I had starting Christmas Eve. I haven't had any significant conflicts worth mentioning since the last RfA.  I usually try to be reasonable and try to see the other's perspective when in a conflict.  So I will discuss how I feel I have matured since my last RfA.  One of the major concerns was temperament, how I tend to make rash decision, judge too quick, or quite overly emotional during a stressful situation.  I recall someone opposing my previous RfA because of said temperament issues, because in a heated dispute, I just switched all of my bots off and left.  Ever since temperament concerns were brought up to me, I have worked on them.  I would like to think that if someone is being confrontational, that I can remain calm, civil, and rational.  I would like to think the interactions I've had with users since my last RfA can prove that.  I'm always working to improve myself as an editor who can be easily communicated with, and trust to receive a civil response in return.

;Additional questions from [[User:Leaky caldron|Leaky]]
:'''4.''' Specifically related to the Bot-related functions you already perform, what additional capability will you have that will extend the level of approval you already have as the expert in your chosen area of expertise? 
::'''A:''' I'm not sure if I am interpreting your question correctly, but the quick answer is that I am not granted any additional powers to running bots.  All I can do is run a bot with admin capabilities.  I am still required to seek a community consensus, I am still required to have BAG approve it, and I am still held accountable for the damage it causes, which can be as severe as a cloud desysop.
:::'''Follow up''' In which case, per co-nom. statement ''He needs admin tools for a lot of that work.'' - how does being an Admin help as far as your BOT work is concerned? Thanks.
::::I believe you may be misreading the intended meaning of Kudpung's statement in regards to my current bots.  Becoming an admin will allow me to run an admin bot, but without the admin bit, no matter how much support an adminbot may get, I wouldn't be able to run one since running an adminbot requires the operator to be an admin themselves.  To clarify, I am not solely running this RfA to simply be able to run an adminbot however, as they would require community consensus first before even being allowed to run at all.  Also, supposedly if I were to extend the sysop bit to IABot, for instance, I would seek community consensus for that first as well, although it would only allow it to edit through fully protected articles, since IABot is designed to combat [[WP:LINKROT]] as best as possible.  IABot has hit quite a few of those in the past, though not certain about the present.
:::::'''Follow up'''. I cannot misread an ''intended'' meaning. I took the nom. statement for its everyday meaning. ''His IT work helps hold the content together and provides indispensable tools that enable us to, well, among other things, assess potential for adminship. '''He needs admin tools for a lot of that work.''''' Do you indeed need admin. tools for a lot of that work, or not? 
::::::The quick answer to this question is that all of my bots in operation have been just dandy without the admin bit, but I certainly have been wondering if some of them could be expanded to be more helpful in an admin capacity.  ''Mind you that before I were to implement any of these ideas, I would seek out a consensus for such a function.''  Take for example my RfPP clerking task which clerks at RfPP.  I tend to find that sometimes an admin misses a page when protecting a collection of pages in one request, or that they mistakenly applied the wrong protection.  The clerking task can detect those inconsistencies and correct the protection automatically in those cases, or apply the missing protection that was supposed to be applied.  This would of course be opt-in so it's not forced.  Another example is that we now have a watchlist notice show up every time a new RfA is transcluded.  Well it requires cycling a cookie on the interface page which requires an admin to do.  Granted it's a simple task to do but it could easily be expanded into my current RfX reporter task, if granted admin capability.  I've been wondering if [[User:7SeriesBOT]] should be revived as it was performing admin tasks that were approved.  The only reason it died, from what I gather, is because the operator of it lost the bit.  So can I do bot work without the admin toolkit? Yes, I have been doing so all this time.  Have I encountered situation were I found giving the bot the bit would be useful? Yes.  Is it an absolute requirement that I need to be an admin to develop my bots? No, but I could be more useful as a bot op that way.  I'm only on Wikipedia because it's an open, diverse, community where I feel I can be of use and contribute productively.  It's all I wish to do.
:::::::Thanks for that clarification. [[User:Leaky_caldron|<span style="color:Black;font:bold 8pt kristen itc">Leaky </span>]][[User talk:Leaky_caldron|<span style="color:Green;font:bold 8pt kristen itc">Caldron</span>]] 16:47, 5 January 2017 (UTC)
::::::::Sorry, if felt like you were pulling teeth. :-)
:'''5.''' Your prime nominator refers to your numerous RFC closes. Please link to the latest 5 or 6 of these.
::'''A:''' This is a rather hard question for me to answer, as this answer may likely hurt my RfA, but it's the truth.  My latest one, that I can remember and I believe you remember it too, was the one regarding RfA reform, and after that fiasco, I retreated from RfC closures to reflect on my judgement and how that could have been dealt better.  Though, to be fair, my close of the RfC was the exact same result as the final close, but it did have me reflecting how users can perceive me being [[WP:INVOLVED]] in matters when closing highly visible and important RfCs like that.  Though I didn't consider myself involved, having been a recent participant in an RfA at the time had other users thinking I was closing to affect the outcome of my next RfA.  I retracted my close, but when it was closed again by another user, the result was the same.  All of my other RfCs I can recall were before my previous RfA.  I don't think this has put me out of touch of establishing a consensus from discussions.  I know I'm not listing the latest 5, so feel free to follow up.
:::'''Follow up'''. This is simple. Your nominator clearly states ''Cyberpower has also demonstrated the kind of analysis of consensus expected of admins over '''numerous''' RfC closes.'' It is reasonable to assume that there are more than 1 and not from 5 years ago - a closed issue as far as anyone is concerned. If skills are claimed it is expected that proof is available, it is after all relevant to an Admin. if you were to be involved in Admin. closures. So if you can work with your nominator {{re|WJBscribe}} to strike the relevant claim and explain it's presence (you did review the nomination statement) I believe that would settle the issue. Thanks. 
::::@[[User:Leaky caldron|Leaky]]: Glad to see you're keeping the noms honest... As this question is really directed at my nomination, I hope you don't mind if I reply to your follow up question. I said in my statement above, Cyperpower has closed ''numerous'' RfCs - I didn't say they were particularly recent and didn't mean to give that impression. There was a time when RfAs were run within 4-12 months of users becoming active, so this issue wouldn't arise (all activity being fairly recent), but I think with "older" candidates it is fair to look back at their work from a couple of years ago if it's relevant. Anyway, I ''think'' the following are the 5 most recent RfC closes (if I have missed one or two in the sequence please forgive me) and were about 12-18 months ago:
::::#[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:2015_administrator_election_reform/Phase_II/RfC&oldid=695180204 Wikipedia:2015 administrator election reform/Phase II/RfC] (December 2015) - discussed by Cyberpower and later reverted - but as I recall on the basis of timing and whether he was the correct person to make the close. You will notice that his rationale fairly closely tracks the ultimate outcome.

::::Although Cyberpower has explained why this isn't area of Wikipedia he has been involved with in the last year, I hope he'll consider making himself available as an RfC closer.

;Additional questions from [[User:Xaosflux|<span style="color:#FF9933; font-weight:bold; font-family:monotype;">xaosflux</span>]]
:'''6.''' You mentioned maintaining adminbots in Q1.  Please explain how you view accountability for bot edits, and how that may related to [[WP:ADMINACCT]]:
::'''A:''' In my personal sense, all bot ops are accountable for the edits a bot makes.  When that bot is an adminbot, that accountability is even more strict.  While normal bot edits gone wrong can simply be reversed by any user, admin actions cannot so easily, and can do irreperable damage.  All adminbots need extensive testing based on the functions it's supposed to perform and more trials before they can be allowed to run autonomously.  A failure to do so can cause serious repercussions to both the bot op and the affected targets.
:'''6.1''' <small>(adminbot follow up question)</small> Should a bot account of yours be blocked by another administrator, under what conditions would it be appropriate for you to unblock it yourself?
::'''A:''' So this is a very contentious area, in my opinion.  I feel a bot op shouldn't under normal circumstances unblock their own bot if it was legitimately blocked for malfunctioning, and should have another admin do it my opinion.  This is because if the bot was misbehaving enough to even warrant an immediate block, it should be shown in some manner that the underlying problem has been resolved and that the bot is safe to operate on Wikipedia again.  For illegitimate reasons, such as an obvious mistake such as wrong user getting blocked, or an out of control admin going on a block spree, those can simply be reversed.  However, when in doubt, it's best to contact the blocking admin first about why the bot was blocked if not mentioned in the block reason, fix the underlying problem, run tests, and confirm that the bot has been repaired and should be safe to run.

:'''7''' As a more technical maintainer, when do you feel it is appropriate to edit non-article protected areas requiring admin access via <code>(edituserjs)</code>, <code>(editinterface)</code>, etc?
::'''A:''' Admins shouldn't ever edit a user JS unless it is to fix the code and the user is not active, or the user gives explicit permission, but even then it should be ported to the local user space or to a gadget.  The most recent example would be when IABot's on wiki configuration page was edited by another admin which broke the bot.  Moving on to interface editing, my experience in filing edit requests is that there needs to be consensus for the change, or if it's not controversial, at least a 3 day waiting period to see if there are objections, as it will impact all of Wikipedia.   Also, common sense should be exercised.  If I didn't touch on the point you wanted me to touch feel free to follow up.  I'm not too stingy on the question limit.

;Additional question from [[User:BU Rob13|BU Rob13]]
:'''8.''' As you're largely a technical editor, I feel it's "fair game" to ask you about your technical qualifications. What's your current involvement in XTools? Assuming it's still non-zero, as you're still listed as a developer, what the heck is going on with it? It seems down regularly. I've seen many editors question whether you have a tendency to start projects that you never finish, and you may perhaps want to respond to that in this question, although that's optional.
::'''A:''' So when I first took on xTools, then known as X!'s Tools, it was when [[User:X!]] retired and left SoxBot and his tools unmaintained.  At the time I was a really eager bot op just wishing to be able to contribute something so I took on X!'s Tools and helped [[User:TParis]] to maintain them.  I took over completely when Toolserver was announced to be shutdown, and began porting the code to Tool Labs.  I renamed the tools to xTools to honor X!, and to give it an easier name.  As the tool labs infrastructure kept getting changed, the code became too deprecated to run correctly.  At that point I had invited [[User:Hedonil]] on board who then radically rewrote xTools, and made it way too environment specific to run right, and in the middle of it he left the project leaving me with code I could no longer follow for the life me. :/  The only option was to rewrite the tools, again, but with the constant ongoing pressure of absolutely having working tools, and stuck with code I couldn't comprehend because it was half finished, I ended up giving up and working on projects I wrote myself, and/or taking over dead bots by writing my own equivalent if I need to.  At this point xTools still needs a rewrite, but I'm not the right person for this job.  That honor has now gone to [[User:Matthewrbowker]], and will also be handed off to the Community Tech Team, per {{phab|T153112}}.  So now we have a paid staff of WMF, in conjunction with Matthew to rewrite the tools into a stable state as a goal for 2017.  So yes, I did back away from xTools, because it was simply too impossible to maintain and at that time my time was overbooked in RL.  It has since then calmed down, and now my project that I am focusing on is InternetArchiveBot, and I'm having way too much fun to back away from it any time in the future.  The reason I am still listed as a maintainer is to pretty much grant access to developers who wish to contribute to ensure xTools isn't left as an unmaintained tool.
;Additional question from [[User:Glrx|Glrx]]
:'''9.''' Should bot maintainers be held to stricter standards than editors? In particular, an editor who runs AWB is responsible for all the edits that the script makes on the page (curiously, I have had a bot maintainer imply that he is '''not''' responsible for an erroneous AWB edit). My current watchlist has 20 entries where InternetArchiveBot made the last edit to a page. Ten of those entries are edits to an article page, and ten entries are to the corresponding article talk page. Consequently, I must access both the article and talk page. The talk page is a solicitation asking me to check the URLs that IABot changed. Should bots be assigning thousands of tasks to human volunteer editors? You are not a content editor, but put yourself in a content editor's shoes. Would you appreciate these talk page messages continually coming across your desk? I have no problem with bots making unexpected errors, but I expect the error rate to be extremely small. That raises another issue. If the bot error rate is high and the talk page messages are necessary, then why has the bot been turned loose? On the other hand, if the error rate is acceptably low, then why is the bot putting essentially unneeded messages on the talk page?
::'''A:''' By policy all bot ops are responsible for every edit that comes from an account they own, automated or not, and they must be held accountable for it.  So the definition of stricter standards is a bit ambiguous in this case.  If you write a bot that's disruptive, it gets blocked and the owner warned/reprimanded/blocked depending on severity and intention.  If you do it again, the owner will likely face sanctions of sorts, which violating can lead to blocks, again, depending on intention.  If an editor is being directly disruptive, they tend to receive 4 warnings before getting blocked.  I'm all for policy that keep bot operators in check, and even more so for adminbots.  Now regarding the user you encountered and not owning up to his erroneous AWB edit, he is wrong.  If it's making errors, he should either fix the bug to prevent it from happening again, or stop using altogether.  Now moving on to IABot, the talk page message is on original function from initial approval that I added to attract more attention to bugs needing to be fixed.  After time, my impression is it kind of became a "thing", for lack of a better word, that users expected when they encounter IABot.  IABot is definitely not very error prone, if I had to estimate, less than 0.01% of them have an error.  Of the roughly 500k edits it has made since moving from Cyberbot II to InternetArchiveBot, the bug reports received in comparison is small.  The talk message is an option that can be changed with its on wiki configuration page.  At this point, I'm not inclined to turn it off unless there is evidence from the community that the messages are not helpful, but my current sense is that they are.  I will soon be releasing a new version of the bot, v1.3, which hopefully remove almost all of the remaining problems left behind by older versions of the bot.  If you feel the messages are unhelpful, I am more than happy shutting them off, but I do need to make sure other users don't object to such a change.—[[User:Cyberpower678|'''<span style="color:darkgrey;font-family:monospace">CYBERPOWER</span>''']] <span style="font-family:Rockwell">([[User talk:Cyberpower678|<span style="color:olive">Happy 2017</span>]])</span> 01:16, 6 January 2017 (UTC)
;Additional question from [[User:Ivanvector|Ivanvector]]
:'''10.''' In both your previous and current RfAs you've mentioned a desire to work at [[WP:UAA]], so we can't let you get away without the [in]famous usernames question! You see the following accounts reported at UAA, what is your response as patrolling administrator?
:*EdelmanRick
:*Bushdid711
:*Sockingtonfan8662466453
:*HRHElizabethRegina
:*Kitties!!!🐱🐱🐱🐱🐱🐱
:*InternetArchiveBob
:*Rms125@hotmail.com

::'''A:''' Haha, I was wondering when these questions would crop up.
::*EdelmanRick: It simply appears to be a name that is similar to a couple of notable entries on Wikipedia.  [[Richard Edelman]] and [[Ric Edelman]].  The name Edelman appears to be common enough to AGF and allow, but I would look out for promotional edits and address any possible [[WP:COI]].
::*Bushdid711: I believe you may have been going for bushdid911.  Going for both, 711 is a store name [[Seven Eleven]], so this is a case of [[WP:DISRUPTNAME]], because it can likely still offend others.  Dealing with 911, which is a very tragic moment in American history, I could imagine a plethora of users taking offense to the name.  The username is a clear [[WP:BLPABUSE]].  If the account is being disruptive, it can be immediately blocked for said disruption, as it's clear they're [[WP:NOTHERE]] to build an encyclopedia.  If the user is making good edits, I would instruct the user to get their accounts renamed to something less controversial, and suggest they stop editing until they are renamed.  If they choose to refuse, I would issue a soft username block.
::*Sockington8662466453: A yellow flag is that I believe the string of numbers is a phone number of sorts.  This is either an advertisement of the phone number or can possibly open the target user up to harassment.  If it is a phone number, I would advise the user to rename to a name without it, but that's personal preference.  It's not anything that can be actioned on.  All in all, the username is okay otherwise and there's nothing to merit a username block.
::*HRHElizabethRegina: I had to think about this a bit. We are dealing with a notable position and a notable name.  This is potentially a case of [[WP:IMPERSONATION]].  Granted the username is not an exact real name, but it's quite obvious that it implies [[Elizabeth II]].  I would ask the user to provide proof of identity to info-en{{@}}wikimedia.org, or to provide a new username to be renamed to using a username block.
::*Kitties!!!🐱🐱🐱🐱🐱🐱: It ultimately depends on how the account is behaving.  I personally don't feel emojis are appropriate for usernames, because they make it hard to find the user.  Then again, non-latin characters are allowed in the username.  We have Japanese, arabic, and greek symbols in usernames of English Wikipedia users.  As long as they can easily be reached and provide a clear link to their userspace in their signature, and as long they're being productive, there is no policy based reason to block the user and ask for a username change, as emojis can be classified as non-latin characters.  I would however ask to reconsider the emojis in the username.  With that being said, it could fall under [[WP:DISRUPTNAME]] if the first edit that comes out of the account is an act of vandalism.
::*InternetArchiveBob: This account is clearly intended to impersonate my bot account, and that in itself is disruptive.  It's more than likely that this user will be disruptive and will most likely end up blocked as an impersonation account.  However if it is a genuine user, I would probably ask if they can choose another name to use on Wikipedia.  Since I would likely not be impartial about this, block judgement should be deferred to another admin, as it would be inappropriate for me to block this user.
::*Rms125@hotmail.com: Not a violation of the username policy.  It may not be private but that's just user preference.  I would advise the user to consider a rename however.
::*:Per the comments on the bottom of the page, I made this answer while missing a vital piece of information I was not aware of.  There exists an account [[User:Rms125a@hotmail.com]].  Because the user never signed with his username, I never seen or even thought that this user existed, to my recollection.  I am therefore revising my answer to state that the username would be a clear impersonation account, and will block as such if their edits support that assessment of impersonation, which will most likely be the case.  In the unlikely event that this was an honest mistake, I would urge the new user to change their username, or make it abundantly clear that there is no connection with the account [[User:Rms125a@hotmail.com]].  If this were actually reported to [[WP:UAA]], and if the given reason was impersonation, I would have investigated the claim in regards to impersonation instead of if it's promotional or not.

#'''Strongest Support''' I had only been editing a few months when I saw Cyberpower's first RfA, so I didn't voice my opinion then, but I will now. I enjoy content creation and I think it is an important attribute for admins to have; I'm concerned about the lack of focus on addressing the content-related concerns of the last RfA, but Cyberpower's strengths are a clear net positive. Cyberpower has the demeanor, clue, and competence for the tools, but the bit will also allow them to expand their contributions. Only administrators can run [[WP:ADMINBOT|admin bots]], and Cyberpower is one of the best bot writers we have, so giving them the bit also means they can begin to write and operate bots to automate some administrator tasks. Not only is there no reason to think there will be no harm, there is a potential boon here. Given that, I can't possibly think that Cyberpower's content creation should be an obstacle to a candidate that has the potential to greatly help the encyclopedia in other ways.

#'''Weak support''' - I'm not concerned with edit count percentages or anything like that - almost all admin work is outside the article space, so if a candidate is already focused on that then I don't see a problem. He is a very active global renamer, and can obviously be trusted with access to advanced permissions.

#'''Support''' This user has already made great contributions to Wikipedia through his work with bots, which I believe perform great assistance to the community. Looking through some of the discussion on his talk page, I see no red flags or incivility. For me at RfA, a low mainspace percentage of edit counts doesn't indicate incapability, just someone who spends a lot of time with behind-the-scenes work, which is what most of adminship is in any case.

#'''Support''' If there was one editor who I would [[WP:IAR]] for the usual content requirements, it's Cyberpower. His dedication to technical issues and keeping bits of the project alive, not least the tools on this very RfA process, in the face of sometimes difficult circumstances, is duty beyond the cause. More importantly, he has never shown any interest of wanting the tools for powermongering or wanting to boss people about - he just wants to knuckle down and get on with the job. I'd like to thank Kudpung, who was a key opposer last time, for putting forward a co-nomination, which shows more people now trust him with the tools.

# '''Support''' I have worked with Cyberpower678 in [[m:global rename|global renaming]], and they've shown themselves to be an excellent colleague.

#'''Support''' - I supported with the utmost confidence at the first RfA and thought that the result there was one of the most disappointing RfA results I had seen at the time.  Cyberpower has been a dedicated member to this project, and while content creation is important, content can't be created without the technology driving the project being improved and maintained.

#'''Support''' per Wugapodes, who says almost exactly what I would have. I would have put less emphasis on content creation, but that's about all I would change. Cyberpower's answer to my question is more than adequate. I have no problem with a dev backing away from an important project ''after handing it off to other developers''.

#'''Support''' First, I am not concerned with the mainspace edit count - the candidate is more focused on the technical aspects of the project and I don't doubt his statement that he doesn't want to dive in to some of the more traditional admin areas that benefit most from vast article development experience. As far as wanting to possibly work with admin bots - these types of bots have the strictest scrutiny and the entire community is welcome to comment at any such future BRFA's and they must be supported by community consensus for any tasks - I warn that you may be disappointed that some bot ideas you could have may not get support to run, but others likely will so don't get frustrated with the process. All that being said, C678 has demonstrated rationality and trustworthiness over the last several years and I support him for administrative permissions. — [[User:Xaosflux|<span style="color:#FF9933; font-weight:bold; font-family:monotype;">xaosflux</span>]] <sup>[[User talk:Xaosflux|<span style="color:#009933;">Talk</span>]]</sup> 04:17, 5 January 2017 (UTC)
#'''Support''' - as I did the last time around. Cyberpower678 is truly one of en-Wikipedia's success stories (I really liked that line, {{u|Kelapstick}}). I have seen his development from a kind of an immature editor to this fine and level-headed person. I believe his work speaks for himself and his contributions to the project are very crucial. The work with bots and the software is very important and Cyberpower678 has done a fabulous job with that. Apart from that, withdrawing the previous RfA and to not put the bureaucrats in an awkward situation showed a really mature behavior - that was the point where I strongly believed that he should've rather passed.

#'''Strong Support''', IABot, the creation of this candidate, is incredibly useful for maintaining the verifiability of the encyclopedia. For some perspective that may mean different things to different editors: IABot was the beneficiary of one of last year's [https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Community_Tech/Migrate_dead_external_links_to_archives community wishlist items]. [[WP:LINKROT]] is a real problem, and IABot has done some amazing work combatting it. I have no doubt that the candidate's work as a botop will only be enhanced by the mop, and I trust that that quality of work will continue on with the admin roles mentioned above. Lack of AfD participation doesn't concern me: obviously, we want an excess of admins manning the AfD backlog, but this user's lack of content creation (see oppose section) partnered with his avoidance of deletion if he doesn't know the true toil of being a content creator (a concept that I'm skeptical about) makes me confident that they will do what they know best and learn anything else along the way.

#'''Support''' YES YES YES YES. I've interacted with Cyberpower a lot over the years and he's always been courteous, respectful, and most importantly, willing to learn if he makes mistakes. I don't think the opposes below about bot error rates are grounded in reality. There are plenty of reasons a bot task can go wrong, some of which will break one page or a thousand pages. Personally I think template editing and the MediaWiki namespace is way scarier since it has the potential to break millions of pages at once with way less visibility or review. In any case, I think the main thing to consider is whether Cyberpower learns from his mistakes and avoids them in the future. In my experience, that's usually been the case.

#'''Support''' &mdash; I don't normally get involved with RFAs (my free time is limited to begin with), but I feel it necessary to speak to Cyberpower's past eagerness to help at [[WP:BRFA]] on bot-related issues, too.  I feel it extremely important to note things like that (as well as bot development as a whole) when people show up to say things like "not enough content contributions."  The main thing that matters with admins, at least in my opinion, is demonstrating effort, drive, support, and basically just general care and respect for the creative process as well as the people involved in it.  Sure, content creation is one creative process, but engineering/development work is another process that facilitates content creation as a whole.  And he does that.  I mean, some people ''can'' use "janitorial" tools to paint, but at the end of the day, most mopholders are still expected&mdash;entrusted&mdash;to just help keep the damn lights on and the machinery lubricated per the wishes of the tenants. :P --[[User:Slakr|<span style="color:teal;font-weight:bold;">slakr</span>]]<small><sup>\&nbsp;[[User talk:Slakr|talk]]&nbsp;/</sup></small> 00:27, 7 January 2017 (UTC)

#::It is my stated position that content creation is '''''the''''' most important aspect of editing Wikipedia, and that '''''all''''' admins should have enough experience at content creation to understand the problems faced by those editors.  Regardless of their other experience, I see no real evidence of the nom filling that criteria.  Further, to address another concern of mine, bot operators are, by definition, "super editors", who strongly affect the encyclopedia with their edits, and are not adequately policed under our current regime.  Thus I'm beginning to see that giving the bit to a bot operator can be a dangerous thing. There's not much that can be done about current operators who are already admins, but I think that make a "super editor" even more powerful is not a good idea.

Now everyone has their own opinions, so I try to balance them by establishing a consensus between the conflicting requests.  If it makes you feel better, I do have access to the global rename bit on meta, which is a really dangerous bit to have in the wrong hands as you can literally lock up a Wikipedia server with it when used improperly.

#:::::::: That first example relates to system security – proxy rights.  We should not allow unqualified, unaccountable, anonymous amateurs to tinker with the system's security – that's just asking for trouble.  As a recent example of such trouble, notice that Mike V tinkered with this area ([[WP:IPBE]]) and seemed to upset hundreds of users.  Mike V is also an unqualified student and, even though there was considerable dissatisfaction with his actions and accountability, he still has a massive collection of privileges and so is quite free to do it all over again.  My view is that such operational, security and technical functions should be managed by the systems programmers of the WMF – experienced and qualified professionals who are presumably paid to monitor and maintain the system 24x7 and are properly trained, supervised, audited and accountable.  This is the way that most serious organisations manage their vital systems.  Organisations that don't do this properly tend to suffer accordingly.  See [[Yahoo! data breaches|Yahoo]], for example.

#'''Oppose''' I share Andrew D's concerns about code quality, and therefore if admin bot creation is going to be bundled up in this nom, I have to oppose. Cyberpower is a fine contributor that will not do harm to the project through his own direct actions. I do not have the same confidence of his bot work. [[User:Samsara|Samsara]] 02:52, 5 January 2017 (UTC)
#:Overall, Cyberpower's bots have 1,824,280 edits.  Andrew D has demonstrated a couple hundred reverted test edits.  Giving Andrew a very generous 500 failed edit count, that amounts to a 0.02% failure rate.  What level of accuracy do you require to support?  PLEASE tell me you do not work in information technology if 0.02% scares you.  By comparison, NASA has a 1.64% fail rate for manned spaceflights (0.79% in the last 20 years) and a 8.08% fail rate for unmanned flights (6.68% in the last 20 years).--v/r - [[User:TParis|T]][[User_talk:TParis|P]] 03:02, 5 January 2017 (UTC)

#:: NASA's target for reliability was an overall failure rate of 0.001% for manned missions.  Only achieving about 1% was a major failure and that's why there were Presidential Commissions when things went wrong.  Many organisations expect to do better than this and [[Six Sigma]] is a common goal.  Wikipedia gets away with low levels of accuracy and reliability because it's free, it's not taken seriously and the disclaimer makes it clear that there's no guarantee of quality.

#::::{{ec}} There is quite a difference between sending a person into space, a moon or another planet and editing an article on a website. There is no risk to the health or lives of human beings (with a tiny exception of extreme cyber-bullying which can be done without the buttons and freely elsewhere on the internet anyway) nor will billions of dollars go down the drain. Anecdotally in the organisations where I've worked (ranging from small businesses to large companies and the public sector), the maximum failure rate set in the KPIs has never been that low or close to it. It was high as 30% in one place and even that was reasonable in the context of the type of work being done. Wikipedia will never strive for perfectionism in a way that say Citizendium does, but there is a reason why the latter failed miserably. <font color="teal">[[User:DaGizza|Gizza]]</font> <sup><font color="teal">([[User_talk:DaGizza|t]])([[Special:Contributions/DaGizza|c]])</font></sup> 10:48, 5 January 2017 (UTC)

#'''Oppose''' A total of 5 AfD !votes all from a short period in 2011 does not give me confidence that the person understands the policies involved.

#'''Oppose''' Let me say this first. The candidate is a prolific, valuable and indispensable volunteer. Now to this RFA. It looks like a hastily put together attempt to jump on the current surge in successful RFAs.  Evidence? Following this flyby edit 3 days ago [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Requests_for_adminship&diff=prev&oldid=758000622] the nomination was drafted 24 hours later and launched a futher day afterwards so there is no obvious well thought out plan or more important, preparation. The nomination statement makes claims which the candidate themselves could not initially justify or adequately explain. To the extent that the candidate is duty bound to have read the nominator’s statements while the RfA was in their user space they must accept responsibility for misleading assertions that support to their qualification. They have to expect questions about their nomination statements and, candidly, without causing offence, tell their nominators when statements are factually incorrect. However, it is for concerns relating to quality and accuracy that I oppose this RfA. That the candidate is a prodigious BOT maintainer is not is question. However, a point noted elsewhere rang bells and on checking the previous RfA, mirror a concern I raised at the time. To check for myself if the situation had improved I have examined recent TP archives. I would draw attention to #39 [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Cyberpower678/Archive_39] as a recent, representative example. It contains 53 entries, many related to BOT defect queries. The word “bug” appears 20 times. The candidate appears by way of responses to accept that some of these bugs are the result of work for which they are / were / maybe responsible. The expressed concerns from users are clearly stated. We all make mistakes, so what has this to do with the RfA? If errors are being introduced I fear that the impact could be amplified if they were introduced via Admin tools. I do not support the “bugs in the wild” response. For the frequency of reported defects on a single page covering a month the level of bugs reported is high. Let me make one thing clear, I see immense improvement in personal development and actually wish he were not so dedicated to WP – but that is his choice. In the past there were other reasons to oppose the candidate. I am now concerned only with extra tools inadvertently causing issues in an environment where too few volunteers are available. Before nominators and supporters jump in here – it is my personal opinion / !vote. Others can be assured by whatever assures them.

#:I respect your opinion here.  I don't feel the nomination statement the way it is worded would appear misleading.  It certainly isn't my intention.  To shed some light InternetArchiveBot has an incredibly complex parsing engine that it uses to try to parse sources and references that are formatted in countless possible ways, and to handle them correctly.  You could call it somewhat intelligent in how it handles it, but for those oddities it encounters, it can goof up.  I've been working almost non-stop to factor in almost every contingency when it comes to formatting.  I think it's gotten pretty far.  This is not meant to change your vote, but simply shed light on the fact that less complex bots are easier to test and check than InternetArchiveBot is.—[[User:Cyberpower678|'''<span style="color:darkgrey;font-family:monospace">CYBERPOWER</span>''']] <span style="font-family:Rockwell">([[User talk:Cyberpower678|<span style="color:olive">Happy 2017</span>]])</span> 18:03, 5 January 2017 (UTC)
#::I don't know if you work in software, [[User:Leaky caldron|Leaky caldron]]; I happen to work in software testing automation. Bugs happen despite our best efforts, even with a dedicated QA department. Having bugs in your code (even in live versions) is not a sign of carelessness but an invitation to think creatively. I don't see anything in Cyberpower's work that I would not see in the most skilled developers I have worked with, and I therefore see no need to judge him harshly on this topic. Additionally, I would like to point out that the number of times the word "bug" appears in a page is not a valid way of counting how many bug reports there are. On archive #39, only '''seven''' bugs were filed (not twenty). One was dismissed, two went unanswered, and the remaining four were worked on.

=====General comments=====
*'''Support''' - a delightful and fairly experienced editor. Lack of content creation, in my opinion, shouldn't be a problem for a candidate who isn't a vandal fighter. No interest in AfDs (as noted by {{u|Collect}} in the previous RfA) is something that I see as a positive - because it indicates that as an admin, he will show no interest in participating in content disputes as well - which he shouldn't be doing anyway giving his lack of familiarity with content. I trust cyberpower that he shall not wield the mop at areas unfamiliar to him. By the way of technical maintenance and running of adminbots, Wikipedia definitely stands to benefit from cyberpower being an admin.

;Regarding second follow-up to Q4
::::::I know the question's not directed at me, but I'll chip in and give one example. [[User:Cyberpower678/RfX Report]] is a popular page that is transcluded in lots of places, most obviously [[WP:RFA]], [[WT:RFA]] and [[WP:BN]]. It's such a useful and widely-used template, that it really should be in project space, and given the transclusions it would be appropriate to ''at least'' put [[WP:PINKLOCK|template protection]] on it. Since I don't believe we have any policy or process to grant TE permissions to bots, {{u|Cyberbot I}} would need an adminbot's level of trust to be able to operate. Frankly, that report has probably only avoided vandalism by obscurity and pure chance - I believe an IP could wander in off the street and replace the template with a "colourful" image on Commons, for example (and no, I haven't tried it). Indeed, looking through the logs I see that {{user|178.42.215.223}} has had a pretty good go at vandalising it, putting nonsense on one of the most widely-viewed project pages in the whole of the site.

*:Thank you for bringing up that point.  I was not aware there was an account by that name, and if it was reported to UAA as being an impersonation account, I would certainly investigate and act on that claim.  As for the email, I may be interpreting the wording of the policy wrong, but my impression was that it was okay to have an email username as long as it simply identifies the user and isn't blatantly promotional, like samiam@intel.com.  What made me, as such, consider this username acceptable, moving the impersonation issues aside, is that hotmail is a public email platform that anyone can use, while intel does not hand out email addresses to the public.
