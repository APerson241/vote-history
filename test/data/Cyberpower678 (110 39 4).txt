====Nomination====
{{User|Cyberpower678}}&nbsp;– If you asked me if I'd be nominating Cyberpower678 for adminship when I was first introduced to him - I'm have given a cautious 'no'.  There are a lot of great attributes to say for the guy - but I was concerned a great deal about his...enthusiasm.  I was concerned that he would get involved in technical matters that were above his talent, or processes that he hadn't fully understood, or in disputes that would cause him to shut down.  I am so ashamed that I hadn't had more confidence in Cyberpower678 from the start.  He deserved better than my ill-conceived judgements.  He's made a fool out of me - proven me very wrong.

Cyberpower and I met shortly after [[User:X!]]'s retirement.  X!'s toolserver account expired and I just happened to be on IRC with a toolserver account at the time it happened.  I took over the tools out of necessity at the time and I had no intention of them becoming "TParis'" tools.  I took great effort to remind everyone that they were X!'s and I merely hosted them.  I performed very little maintence other than to keep them online.  Along came skipperdy-do-da with lots of ideas and asking for my support to let him write for the tools.  I was reluctant at first but he kept bugging me - over and over and over again.  Finally, with WMFLabs coming along, we agreed to transfer the tools into a project that we both could manage.  I should have handed over the project sooner - Cyber took those tools and ran and what he transformed them into is astounding.

I'm sorry, this is going to rattle on a bit.

Cyberpower678 is not a great "content creator" - I'll admit.  But, he's also not your generic vandalism patroller either just looking for access to that block button.  He's a technically competent and process-savvy asset to the project.  He has undertaken [[User:Worm_That_Turned/Adopt/Cyberpower678|Worm's adoption]] in 2012, he has helped [[Talk:Tea_Party_movement/Moderated_discussion|moderate contentious discussions]], he's been very active at the [[Wikipedia:Village_pump_(technical)|technical village pump]], rewrote [https://tools.wmflabs.org/xtools-ec/?user=Cyberpower678&project=en.wikipedia.org|X!'s tools] and operates [[User:Cyberbot_I]] and [[User:Cyberbot_II]].  His technical expertise with the MediaWiki database and API make him a superb candidate for writing admin bots, working with templates which require the admin bit, and within in contentious areas to help solve disputes where we'd normally require admins.  I think Cyberpower has the calm demeanor, knowledge level, and persistence to handle admin functions.  On top of that, he shows introspective capabilities to recognize when it's appropriate to back out of a situation that is overwhelming - a skill many admins (including myself when I had the bit) lack.  Further, I hope this is a step for Cyberpower678 toward B'Cratship where he'd be a tremendous (read TREMENDOUS) asset at [[WP:BRFA]]. v/r - [[User:TParis|T]][[User_talk:TParis|P]] 20:34, 1 July 2015 (UTC)

====Co-nomination====
I've been waiting for this day for a while. When I first met Cyberpower678 four years ago I knew he would make a fantastic admin one day. I believe that day has come. 

Back in 2011 he was an enthusiastic young editor who was eager to use his skills to improve the project to the best of his abilities. The only problem was that he had trouble reigning in that enthusiasm and it got him in trouble a few times. He even managed to get indefinitely blocked back in November 2011. But that's a long time ago and the editor we are asking you to consider for adminship has grown both in maturity and "cluefullness" to the extent that he is hardly recognisable as the same editor. Indeed, he has developed into one of the most helpful Wikipedia contributors that the project has. The only thing that has not changed is his enthusiasm. If only there were more like him. 

It is my considered opinion that giving Cyberpower678 the mop and associated admin responsibilities is a no-brainer. Just do it!

====Co-nomination====
As a member of the xTools team, I have worked closely with Cyberpower678 for some time now. Myself an administrator, I can attest to how his work has had a direct and profound effect on the admin community. Maintenance and development of the [[WP:RFPP]] bot, for instance, or [[User:Cyberbot I/Requests for unblock report|RFU report]] and {{tl|adminstats}}, are wondrous clerking features us admins take for granted everyday. Any issues with his bots are promptly addressed, exemplifying his dedication toward the project and diligence to keep things running smoothly. I can only imagine how adminship would not only assist Cyberpower678 further with these efforts, but also open the door to put his technical talents to play with admin bots, or work within the MediaWiki namespace. From within the xTools team, Cyberpower678 has shown excellent leadership skills, with a strong commitment to consensus-driven administration and onboarding of new maintainers. He is also admirably humble about other projects, such as the popular [https://tools.wmflabs.org/supercount/ supercount user analysis tool], where he took extra caution to get backing from the community before making some statistics publicly available. This for me contradicts any doubt he can handle the role of adminship responsibly, and won't impulsively mash buttons. The [[WP:MAINSPACE|mainspace]] is surely not where he will shine, but I believe his specialized proclivity and initiative will excel in other areas where bearing a mop would benefit the entire project. <span style="font-family:sans-serif">&mdash; <span style="font-weight:bold">[[User:MusikAnimal|<span style="color:black; font-style:italic">MusikAnimal</span>]] <sup>[[User talk:MusikAnimal|<span style="color:green">talk</span>]]</sup></span></span> 00:17, 3 July 2015 (UTC)

====Questions for the candidate====
Dear candidate, thank you for offering to serve Wikipedia as an administrator. Please answer these questions to provide guidance for participants:
:'''1.''' What administrative work do you intend to take part in?
::'''A:''' I would probably immediately start working in username areas such as [[WP:UAA]].  Even though I don't have any contribs there, my experience with ACC makes me more than familiar with username policy.  Also having the admin bit will be useful if ACC has a mistaken account creation.  It's rare, but known to happen.  I do have a few ideas for potential admin bots.  Operating an adminbot requires the op to have the sysop bit as well.  I frequently lurk around [[WP:RFPP]], so I would start taking up page protections as well.  Having template editor rights, I tend to go around addressing template protected edit requests.  Having the bit would allow me to expand to fully protected edit requests for pages, templates, and interface pages.

:'''2.''' What are your best contributions to Wikipedia, and why?
::'''A:''' I would like my contribution to speak for themselves.  I'll admit, my content work isn't going to impress any FAC reviewer.  I've been primarily involved with ACC, bot work, and maintaining tools such as xTools and Quentinv57's tools.  I'm currently working on getting xTools completely rewritten in coordination with the xTools team.  I feel my greatest contribution would be introducing a fully stable set of tools that is so popular among the community.

:'''3.''' Have you been in any conflicts over editing in the past or have other users caused you stress? How have you dealt with it and how will you deal with it in the future?
::'''A:''' My biggest conflict got me indefinitly blocked for oversight issues, when I seriously lacked clue.  I tried to be a moderator of a dispute, and ended up screwing up big time.  ArbCom was generous enough to unblock me days later.  Needless to say I learnt my lesson and avoided a repeat.  In another conflict, I was edit warring, where I caught myself having crossed the 3RR limit.  I immediately acknowledged that I violated policy and was admonished instead of blocked. Back in my earlier Wikipedia volunteer career, I see myself as having been pretty stubborn, and thick headed, I took offense easily when I didn't agree with something, and caused quite some drama sometimes.  I was practically bordering [[WP:NOTHERE]] in my opinion.  Reflecting on my past, I realized I needed to change.  I'd like to think that I have mellowed, become more mature, responsible, and most importantly level-headed and reasonable.  I'm bound to make mistakes, but I'd like to think that my editing history shows that I am capable of learning from my mistakes and improving.

;Question from Biblioworm
:'''4.''' If I'm not mistaken, you were "Retired" as recently as a few months ago. Why are you seeking adminship so soon after you became active again?
::'''A:''' I'm honestly not sure what you are talking about.  I don't recall retiring myself at all.  If you could possibly elaborate, that would be very helpful.  I might be missing something here.
:::Hmm. There must be something seriously wrong with my memory if you never did, because I'm absolutely certain that I once saw a "Retired" template on your page. I'll try to find it, if I can. But, then again, I'm approaching the age where that sort of thing starts to happen, so perhaps I shouldn't be too surprised... --[[User:Biblioworm|<span style="color:#6F4E37;">'''''Biblio'''''</span>]][[User_talk:Biblioworm|<span style="color:#6F4E37;">'''''worm'''''</span>]] 02:37, 3 July 2015 (UTC)
::::His usage fell off to almost nothing for a few months last fall [https://tools.wmflabs.org/supercount/index.php?user=Cyberpower678&project=en.wikipedia.org&toplimit=10], maybe that's what you are thinking of. --[[User:MelanieN|MelanieN]] ([[User talk:MelanieN|talk]]) 02:53, 3 July 2015 (UTC)
::::An alternative possibility was given by TParis [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ARequests_for_adminship%2FCyberpower678&type=revision&diff=669717989&oldid=669717938 here]. [[User:Samsara|Samsara]] 12:28, 3 July 2015 (UTC)
;Question from '''[[User:Andrevan|Andrevan]]'''[[User_talk:Andrevan|@]]
:'''5.''' You were previously indef-blocked. Can you explain the conditions that led to the block and what won't go wrong in the future? '''[[User:Andrevan|Andrevan]]'''[[User_talk:Andrevan|@]] 02:22, 3 July 2015 (UTC)
::'''A:''' Back when I still had a non-existent clue level, I decided to try and settle a dispute between two editors regarding some UFC article.  I believe the concern was regarding the citizenship of one of the fighters.  So thinking it was the smart thing to do I attempted to contact the person and then ended up [[WP:OUT]]ing the person.  WilliamH was oversighting my edits and then blocked me on Thanksgiving Day, 2011, when the dispute got out of control.  Having to contact ArbCom to get unblocked they helped me to understand what I was doing wrong.  When I read through relevant policies, I simply learnt my lesson and learnt to not do it again.  Getting indefinitely blocked was something I felt horrible about.  To simply put it, what won't go wrong in the future is that I will instead use secondary reliably sources and never out anyone.  As an ACC member, I'm also always taking great care to not inadvertently divulge private information.  As for my second block, that was a Twinkle misclick that glitched.  I also create [[User:Cyberpower678/Why I was blocked]] a while ago, in case anyone was curious.

;Question from [[User:Stuartyeates|Stuartyeates]]
:'''6.''' On which topic do you consider yourself to be furthest from the general Wikipedia consensus?
::'''A:''' The one topic that does immediately come to mind when answering this is RfA.  It seems to be a process that many can agree on that needs changing.  Countless discussions regarding it were started, but no one can ever seem to agree on how to change it.  So RfA is always remains an unchanged process.

; Optional [[User:Jc37/RfA/Questions|questions]] from [[User:Jc37|jc37]]
:In order to help determine whether you meet [[User:Jc37/RfA/Criteria|my criteria]] (including your knowledge/understanding of policies and processes in relation to the tools and responsibilities that go along with [[Wikipedia:Adminstrators|adminship]]), please answer the following questions.

:*'''7.''' Please describe/summarise '''why and when''' it would be appropriate for you to apply the policy to [[WP:IAR|ignore all rules]] to a situation, while also explaining the interdependency between: following current [[WP:CON|consensus]] (such as existing [[WP:POLICY|policy]] or [[WP:GUIDELINES|guidelines]]), [[WP:BOLD|being bold]], and [[Wikipedia:Requests for comment|seeking consensus]]. 
::*'''A:'''  I've personally never been in an instance where I felt it was acceptable to invoke IAR.  So my action if I felt it necessary would be to consult the community first for input.  While being BOLD can work, it can also have unintended consequences.  To be accurately able to gauge what all of the community is thinking at one time, or predict how they will react to being BOLD is impossible.  In any case when it comes to IAR, I would rather have a voice from the community to back up my reason for wanting to invoke IAR.  What are some possible instances I should want to invoke IAR? With the recent request for resysop on the 'crats noticeboard, seemed to have stirred up a lot of controversy even though the editor in question didn't really leave under a cloud.  Policy wise the 'crats' hands are tied and the concerns mentioned aren't really grounds for declining resysop.  What if a good deal of editors each brought up unique concerns, and if ArbCom didn't invoke a temporary injunction, would that be enough to invoke IAR and deny resysop?  Perhaps, but I would still consult other 'crats in that regard.  In any case IAR is something I would consider and use with care if I did feel the need IAR was necessary, and only if my intended actions are supported by community consensus.

:*'''{{#expr: 7 + 1}}.''' How would you personally determine whether you are [[WP:INVOLVED|involved]] in any particular situation, such as when deciding whether you should [[Wikipedia:Closing discussions|close a discussion]], or whether you should be the one to [[WP:BLOCK|block]] (or unblock) an editor and/or [[WP:PROTECT|protect]] (or unprotect) a page.
::*'''A:''' Being involved for me means that I have been active in an area which could result in a biased opinion.  So if I took part in a discussion, it can indicate that I have enough interest in the subject to comment on it.  As such I could have a biased opinion, and therefore am considered involved in the discussion.  When it comes to blocking a user, or unblocking a user, it's important to consider if I've been active around the editor, whether I have a prejudged opinion against them, or if I have interacted with the user.  An example would be an administrator and an editor are in a dispute over some edit on an article.  The administrator sees the edit from the editor as disruptive but not enough to justify it as blatant vandalism.  It would be improper of the administrator to block the editor.  A thread on the talk page should be started and if necessary brought to ANI.  The same thing applies to protecting pages.  If I am a regular editor on an article, unless I am constantly reverting obvious vandalism I should not be protecting the page if I am seeing edits I do not agree with.  This question does bring me back to the Pending Changes RfC.  It was big, and I was still pretty eager back then, so I wanted to close, but I also already had expressed my support for.  I was adamant on closing, and even prompted a discussion.  I did eventually step down, but looking back, this was a perfect instance where I was involved and shouldn't have even offered to take part in the closing discussion.

:*'''{{#expr: 7 + 2}}.''' How do you determine [[Wikipedia:Consensus|consensus]] from a discussion? And how may it be determined differently concerning an [[WP:RFC|RfC]], an [[WP:RM|RM]], an [[WP:XFD|XfD]], or a [[WP:DRV|DRV]].
::*'''A:''' The most important thing to keep in mind when determining consensus is that strength of an argument is key.  No matter where consensus is being determined, that rule always applies, but determining consensus is also different in different areas.  For example at an XfD, if many believe that the article should be deleted, but one editor comes by and provides an excellent reason, that reason should carry more weight in consideration.  In an unlikely scenario if someone were to nominate for deletion for lacking notability, and there are 6 delete !votes, and then 1 keep.  If the keep suddenly provided a plethora of sources demonstrating notability, that would be enough grounds to close as keep, as that editor has just proven notability.  In an RfC, however, since the primary role is to request for comments and possibly a proposal, the overall community wishes need to be considered.  One compelling support shouldn't override the obvious opposition it is receiving from other users.  An RfC is a request for the opinions for other editors and it won't do any good to consider one editors opinion over another.

:*'''{{#expr: 7 + 3}}.''' User:JohnQ leaves a message on your talk page that User:JohnDoe and User:JaneRoe have been reverting an article back and forth, each to their own preferred version. What steps would you take?
::*'''A:''' I'd first investigate the situation.  If they are clearly edit warring, without any attempts to discuss on the talk page, or have already crossed [[WP:3RR]], I would block involved parties for 24 hours, <s>to let them cool off</s> and advise them to discuss the edit dispute before further editing.  If the issue has already stopped and a discussion did start in the meantime, I would deem a block unnecessary.  I would however warn them of it, especially if they crossed [[WP:3RR]].  If they end up warring again after my warning, I might need to consider a block.  This is all provided I'm not already involved. EDIT: The scratched out term was a poor choice of words as cool off blocks are highly discouraged.

:*'''{{#expr: 7 + 4}}.''' Why do you wish to be an administrator?
::*'''A:''' While I have no objections to not being an administrator, I feel I could help out the admin corps in areas I feel strong in.  This answer I feel has mostly been answered in number 1 however, I'm no content creator.  With that, I don't really do much on wiki.  Most of the work is bots, tools, and ACC which is more off wiki than onwiki.  This may read a little weird, but being an admin would allow me to contribute more onwiki.  I've noticed that editors that are prolific content creators, that become admins end up fading away as a content creator and start to focus primarily on cleaning up with the mop.  As I'm not a content creator, I'm not fading from one circle and joining another.  I feel with what I do on Wikipedia, I would be a better admin than a content editor.

:*'''{{#expr: 7 + 5}}.''' I've encountered you around many community discussions, and a theme that seemed to me to be recurring is that you would volunteer to close discussions which you were involved, or which you had voiced an opinion about. And then when others showed concern, it took some "discussion" for you to decide to withdraw from closing.  Now, there are times when it may be necessary to close such a discussion, and we trust our admins to show discernment in that, as in most things. So here's my question (an addendum to #8): Concerning the sentence: "There's always another admin"? What does it mean to you, and under what circumstances, if ever, should it be applied? - <b>[[User:Jc37|jc37]]</b> 03:39, 3 July 2015 (UTC)
::*'''A:''' I've actually mentioned something like that in question 8.  This also goes to my answer for question 3, where I mentioned that I self reflect on my actions every time.  That RfC was something I reflected on.  I was clearly involved and should have never volunteered to close, especially since !voted to support it.  To answer this specific question, the statement to me means there's another admin just as qualified to do the work.  None of us irreplaceable.  More to the point though, sometimes it's more desirable to leave the work in someone else's capable hands.  However you don't always want, need, or have to push the work into someone else's hands.  The RfC for example, I picked up the stick and never wanted to let go, but I eventually dropped it, once it became clear I shouldn't close an RfC I participated in.  I should've let another admin pick up the stick instead.  Letting go is another thing I took to heart from that RfC.

;Additional question from [[User:Σ|Σ]]
:'''13.''' You lead a busy life, full of activities, many of which are required of you. Tell about something you do for the pleasure of it.
::'''A:''' I'm not quite sure what I'm supposed to answer here.  I study Electrical Engineering and it's quite demanding on time.  But it's rewarding.  In my free time, I hang out with friends, play games, and/or code stuff for me or Wikipedia.  Family time for me is also important.  I always keep up to date with my cousin by Skyping him.  Because most of my family live in Europe while I live in America, I always try to find time to visit them.

;Additional question from [[User:Leaky caldron|Leaky]]
:'''14.''' Before your current identity (November 2011) you claim to have "been a contributor of Wikipedia for years. However, vandalism started getting out of control and so you developed this account". Please clarify whether that was a registered account and what the reference to vandalism getting out of control referred to.
::'''A:''' Oh boy.  I clearly remember doing little things such as fixing typos as an IP, when I read Wikipedia articles.  Please don't ask me to recall the IP addresses.  In any case I only really started getting involved when I created this account.
:'''15.''' Do you still follow certain Admins. without hesitation or do you now think for yourself
::'''A:''' If I hadn't thought for myself then, I certainly do now.  Back then I considered myself to still be in the learning process, in which case I would have blindly taken an admin's word at face value.  With my 4 years here, I can confidently say I have sufficient experience to generate my own educated opinion over matters, and I can most certainly think for myself.  If your questioning whether I would let myself be manipulated by an admin, then my answer is no.
:'''16.''' Is that stress indicator serious or a joke?
::'''A.''' My stress indicator is quite serious.  I feel it important users on Wikipedia know if I'm going through stress or not.  When I started college, I really started to learn to cope with stress and relieve it.  I find myself less stressed about things than before I started college.
:'''17.''' This screed 2.5 years ago was a bit self-pitying. [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ACyberpower678&type=revision&diff=516865599&oldid=516848139| notice to leave the community]. What changed your mind and what's changed with your temperament in the meantime?
::'''A:''' Hmm...It's hard to remember what was going through my mind, but if I have my timeline still correct, I believe I was going through a stressful situation in RL, that I was having trouble coping with regarding family matters.  With that stress on my chest, I felt I was screwing everything up on Wikipedia, and my judgement was off.  The indefinite break allowed me to deal with RL situations and cool off.  That's about all I could remember about it.  The note could have been better worded, or not even worded at all.  If I saw the need for a break, the best thing to do would simply go on break and try and grab attention to my self, and certainly not through a self-pitying notice like.  I agree with you on that.  Reading that post from 2.5 almost 3 years ago, it does seem self-pitying and perhaps [[WP:DIVA]]ish.
;Additional question from [[User:Northamerica1000|Northamerica1000]]
:'''18.''' How do you perceive the overall state of [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion|Articles for deletion]] at this time?
::'''A:''' Regarding the extent of your question, I'm not certain what you want me to answer about, but from what I'm seeing there, it could use more admins there.

<!-- {{subst:Rfa-question|Number of question|2=Question}} -->
;Additional question from [[User:Philg88|Philg88]]
:'''19''' When you say that you "have a few ideas for potential admin bots", what exactly would they do? Is the admin bit required such that they can carry out deletion/blocking operations without human interraction?
::'''A''' The first adminbot I would probably create is a revived version of [[User:7SeriesBOT]].  From what I'm aware of, it is still approved but the botop lacks sysop rights.  I saw it as quite a useful bot to have especially if a user is not a sysop.  I would port the code and update it as necessary to get the bot functioning correctly again.  [[User:Cyberbot III]] would assume adminbot roles.  I created the page many whiles ago, so I would need to update it to reflect my latest intentions.  Also another idea I've been working on is, since inactive sysops get their rights stripped, inactive users should too.  This would be something I would run by the community before implementing such a bot.  Adminbots have a potential to deal a massive amount of damage to the encyclopedia, which is why careful consideration, planning, and coding is needed.  So the other ideas I will only mention and run by the community after carefully considering the ups and downs of such a bot.  I hope this is a satisfactory answer to your question.  If you have any follow questions, feel free to ask them.

;Additional questions from [[User:DESiegel]]:
:'''20.''' What is your view of [[WP:PI|Process is important]]?
::'''A:''' Process has been established for good reasons, and through community consensus.  Wikipedia is a consensus driven process, and ignoring the process would be ignoring consensus, which is typically a disruption to Wikipedia, with a few rare cases.  I agree with what [[WP:PI]] is saying and that if there is the need to do an out of process action, such as [[WP:IAR]], that consensus should be sought out first.

:'''21.''' How strictly should the literal wording of the [[WP:CSD|speedy deletion criteria]] be applied?
:: '''A:''' While my involvement in the use of CSDs is practically non-existent, I feel that the literal wording should be strictly applied.  CSDs, prompt fast deletions and vague wording or interpretation can cause a legitimate article to be deleted.  For the purposes of this answer, let's call a legitimate article being deleted, a false positive, while an article that should be deleted not getting deleted, a false negative.  If the interpretation of the CSD is too vague, it could be responsible for false positives, whereas if the interpretation was strict, it would likely be responsible for false negatives.  In my opinion, false negatives are addressed by simply expanding the wording of the deletion criteria.  Any article that has a CSD must meet the CSD perfectly, otherwise a discussion over its deletion should be held.  If necessary a new CSD criteria could be created, if consensus favors the criteria.  In my overall, ensuring that premature deletion doesn't happen is a better option.

:'''22.''' What is the place of [[WP:IAR]] in carrying out administrative actions?
:: '''A:''' This slightly ties into questions 7 and 20.  I explained most of it in question 7 but as an administrator if there is a need to [[WP:IAR]], there should be voice from the community backing that need.  Else [[WP:WHEEL]] may happen following in an emergency desysop.

:'''23.''' An admin is often expected or requested to help others, particularly new users, and to aid in calming disputes, either resolving them or pointing the participants to proper venues for resolution. How do you see yourself in this aspect of an Admin's role?
::'''A:''' Since I already work in [[WP:ACC]] I'm not only helping new users, I'm creating them.  They come to us seeking help in getting started after they have their account.  This requires me to be familiar with policy in regards to editing articles and being able to direct them to the proper locations to allow them to get things done.  To answer your question, I'm already partially fulfilling that role.  I shouldn't have much issue spreading out on that role.  I also would like to think that I don't [[WP:BITE]] which is important, especially for new users.

::'''A:''' The only thing I could say is that I was providing the English translations of titles based on the same official media sources for the television series Pokemon.  Though I wasn't referencing it, I was using official sources that are listed on the bottom of the article.

;Additional question from [[User:Bosstopher|Bosstopher]]
:'''26.''' Apologies for piling another question onto this already huge mountain of questions. You're browsing reddit one day when you see a post from someone with the username koskesh, boasting about how he's planning to disrupt Wikpedia in a certain way. You've also recently noticed a user:Koskesh on Wikipedia doing exactly what the reddit koskesh is boasting about. How do you approach this situation? Is it a violation of [[WP:OUTING]] to point out a connection between the two accounts?
::'''A:''' Technically [[WP:OUTING]] allows the linking of wiki accounts to external accounts on a case by case basis.  Personally though, I wouldn't link the two together.  If the user is being persistently disruptive, regardless if they boasted about it elsewhere, the account would be blocked disruption.  I'm always taking great care to not inadvertantly divulge private information about users.  It's required of me at [[WP:ACC]].

;Additional question from [[User:Catfish Jim and the soapdish|Catfish Jim and the soapdish]]
:'''27.''' You've been asked far more questions than most get during an RFA. Too many, perhaps. But I'm going to ask you another. [[User:Worm That Turned|Worm TT]] raised an interesting point about admin recall in his support !vote. What is your opinion on [[Wikipedia:Administrators open to recall|administrator recall]]? Would you add yourself to that category if you became an administrator? Why or why not?
::'''A:''' The infamous recall question.  Yes I would be open to recall.  Here's my criteria for recall.  If a thread at AN or ANI gains consensus, where the topic is about whether I'm fit to retain the bit or not, any user may open a reconfirmation RfA, provided I am notified of the discussion.  During the RfA, my sysop bits will be suspended until the RfA closes.  The 'crats will then determine whether I should be given back the bit or not.

;Additional question from [[Beyond My Ken]]
:'''28.''' Please explain why 40.2% of your contributions are to User Talk pages.
::'''A:''' Because I do tool and bot work, most of my user talk edits are me responding to questions, regarding them.  Note that most of the user talk edits are my user talk page.  Before xTools moved to Labs, I was frequently communicating to TParis regarding the maintenance of the code.  I also took up WormTT's adoption program which also involved a lot of userspace edits.  The remaining edits are normal conversation regarding miscellaneous matters on Wikipedia.

;Another question from Biblioworm
:'''29.''' Please explain what you meant when you said this in question 19: "Also another idea I've been working on is, since inactive sysops get their rights stripped, inactive users should too." Are you saying that inactive users should lose their ability to even ''edit''? 
::'''A.''' Wait...what?  Remove their ability to edit, as in, block?  Absolutely not.  I wouldn't even support a bot that blocks inactive users.  I'm talking about proposing the idea of removing advanced permissions from inactive users, such as Template Editor, Autopatrolled, Reviewer, Rollbacker, Account Creator, and Abuse Filter.  This idea for a bot still needs community consensus however and development of such a bot will not proceed until there is one.  To clarify, this is simply an idea.

Most of the time, we want more content in a candidate's background, but he more than makes up for it with his technical experience, and frankly, we also need tech admin.

On his talk page he often has people yelling at him over some technical problem or other, even though he is just a volunteer like the rest of us. But he stays calm and focused on the problem.

#:11th-hour upgrade to '''strong support''' with thanks to the candidate for level-headed and patient responses to an unreasonable number of questions and some poorly reasoned opposition. "I oppose because you might not follow ''my'' priorities about which tasks ''you'' should work on" is not a collegial way to treat a fellow volunteer. Treating primarily technical contributors dismissively, and acting as if the rest of us are somehow owed the product of their efforts in a way that's rarely applied to article writers, is another one of those long-term community behaviors that hasn't changed much over time despite being clearly counterproductive.

#'''Support''' It's been a while, but I used to work very closely with Cyberpower. Back then, he was not suitable for adminship. Anyone knows my history on wikipedia can probably work out where my involvement came in. Now, there is a niche that Cyberpower will fill very nicely, that of a technical admin. The progress he has made from there to here is exceptional, he's always willing to hear feedback. As long as he realises that there is extra responsibility with these tools and that he should remain open to feedback, I am sure he'll do well. I hope, too, that he opens himself to recall to keep himself in check. To this day, if he ever needs advice, my door is open.

As time passed however, he has grown to a more mature editor who's willing to listen to feedback and concerns before taking actions, which is an important attribute for an admin. Having said that, I do echo Kudpung's and others concerns that when the strength of this request is based on your technical work, your technical work still has areas which leave something to be desired. Learn to say no (or stop saying yes) to technical requests/ideas if you don't have time for it.

These things must be seperated, which is why I don't think being a great article creator is a prerequisite.

#'''Support''' - Not every admin has to be a content writer.

# '''Moderate support''' With all the bots/tools my baseline criterium "Is dedicated to the project" is satisfied, but the lack of content contributions is regrettable. Nothing here or on their talkpage to suggest that cyberpower would end up POV-pushing or engage in any serious misbehaviour. The admittedly large number of issues with the tools that I see on their talkpage appear to get addressed in a speedy and professional fashion. An oversight block is obviously a serious issue but a successful BASC appeal (BASC does have a reputation for being extremely strict) as well as the conversations [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Cyberpower678/Archive_1#Unblock_Request here and forward] and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Cyberpower678/Archive_2#RFA_2 here] indicate to me that the issues are addressed (Also, the block was several years ago and happened only a few months into their editorship). Participation in admin areas is a bit low but not problematic enough to concern me. Also, running adminbots is a good suggestion and reason for seeking the mop the way I see it. I do recommend cyberpower to take the advice (esp. by Kudpung) regarding their activity levels, though.

#'''Support'''. I've been following Cyberpower's career for a long time, especially at RfPP, where he probably knows the process and the policy better than anyone but the handful of regular admins. He's a little rough around the edges still, and I might have waited another six months or a year before nominating him, just to be sure, but I have no doubt he'd make an excellent admin and would be a great asset to the project in that position. There can be no doubting that he has the competence and ability to do the job—he's spent a long time being an asset in various admin areas and has gained first-hand experience of how decisions are made there—the only question is over his judgement. Cyberpower's zeal sometimes gets him into trouble—he sometimes wades into complicated issues without assessing the situation beforehand—but I'm confident that he has mellowed (for want of a better word) and will continue to mellow with time and experience. He doesn't lack anything that can't be learnt on the job—adminship is always a learning curve, but Cyberpower has a significant headstart.

#Q7 gives me a bit of pause, and I wonder what the nominee would do if confronted with a situation where another IAR'ed, and would urge the nominee to exercise caution in such a circumstance.  Q21 is precisely on target.  I am perpetually baffled by activity level concerns - an admin who is around only sometimes still helps the backlogs, etc. more than one who was never appointed in the first place.  I suppose there may be some justification for them on the basis of ongoing change in policy and practice, but I would hope that any admin would have the good sense to be aware of such issues when returning from a period of reduced activity.  Finally, while I don't know if we actually ''need'' technically-focused admins, I don't see how having another could possibly hurt!

# '''Support'''  Like TParis, I didn't expect to ever support CP678 but I watched him mature and mellow and improve over time.  His lack of content contribution concerned me.  No one understands content creation until they do some.  There's no substitute for experience.  But for the foreseeable future, maybe he shouldn't contribute to articles; no one has ever accused him of writing <i>elegant prose</i> and I don't expect to see any in the near future.  Needing Q29 to clarify the answer to Q19 is telling.  I could go on but in the end, it's about trust.  I trust that CP678 will never knowingly misuse administrator tools.

=====Oppose=====
#'''Oppose''' I am somewhat swayed by Kudpung's argument regarding unfinished business in a major area of the applicant's contributions. I am aware that it may seem punitive to deny a candidate progression seemingly ''because'' they are actually contributing positively; however, as per biblioworm's comment that main space contributions are lacking (and, perhaps symptomatically, the tools are only 10% working and don't allow me to verify the relevant info), and this application feeling strongly predicated on the candidate's contributions in the tools arena, I feel it is appropriate.

However the fact that this is happening at all is very telling of the quality of your maintenance for your bots.</p><p>So throughout your archives we can see people complaining about bots not functioning as intended, and at the same time you're quick to jump at requests for bots, while you're swamped by real life and planning to work on xtools.

#'''Oppose'''. Too many red flags for me, starting with very little article-space work, and no more than 8 edits on any article except Pokemon articles. Out of 4 years of editing and 15,000 edits (not really outstanding for an admin candidate), more than 3/4 are on user talk (40%), user page (18%), and Wikipedia space (16%). 15% semi-automated edits. Technical proficiency, tool creation and maintenance, and technical enthusiasm are insufficient qualifications for adminship, and in fact to me a sign that the user may be out of touch with Wikipedia guidelines, policies, and best practices. I dislike it when people are voted in with overly brief rationales such as "Why not?" and "Adminship is [[WP:NOBIGDEAL]]" (a sentiment from over 12 years ago). As anyone should know given the amount of admin drama, abuse, and attempted recalls we've had in the last 5 or so years, adminship is a very big deal, should be very carefully considered, and entails an enormous amount of trust, responsibility, and power. I'm not impressed with the rationale of the nominators.

#::The above comment, as well as being factually incorrect is also proven total nonsense by the passage of time. A number of questions have been unanswered for over 30 hours – despite the editor contributing elsewhere in the meantime. More to the point, the fact that over 30 people would lend their support in a few hours to someone not only without any proven article-writing talent, but who also apparently dispenses incomplete automation tools and has a queue of dissatisfied customers lining up on his talk page is very troubling. Almost as troubling as imagining Cyber trying to use his newly awarded powers to settle a content dispute or (as he has frequently done) inserting himself into ANI disputes and instead of pouring oil onto troubled waters, ending up exacerbating the situation by declaring the contributions of one or other sides, as in this example:  “the morality of putting such a comment on a nominators talk page is despicable”. An Admin. employing morality as a form of judgement sounds like a recipe for the highest possible drama. The lack of quality article contributions alone is unacceptable on a text-based medium. Wouldn't hire a dwarf as an bodyguard, don't want an admin on an encyclopaedia who can't write articles. As for the notion, promise or is it a threat, to develop “Admin Bots” – whatever they are and whatever they do – no thanks. There is more than enough drama created by “human” Admins., without some automated version of [[Madeye Moody]] searching out innocent editors who are about to transgress [[WP:3RR]] or have inadvertently used a dubiously accredited citation. Whatever, my main beef with this candidate is that he has been focused on gaining Admin. rights since his second TP edit, his track record is highly dubious and based on everything I have seen lacks sound temperament and judgement.

#'''Oppose''' There seem to be too many negatives.  For one thing, he makes drive-by edits to controversial articles in response to edit requests.  For example, when browsing his contributions, I notice he [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=2014_Israel%E2%80%93Gaza_conflict&diff=prev&oldid=618097781 edits 2014 Israel–Gaza conflict].

This seems to be [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:2014_Israel%E2%80%93Gaza_conflict&diff=prev&oldid=618097963 a request by an IP editor].

But there is no discussion - just the same mysterious IP editor, making a long complaint.  Now this IP editor seems quite sophisticated, understanding diffs, templates, noticeboards &c.  So why haven't they got an account so they can make the edit themselves?  Is this perhaps due to the heavy sanctions which apply to this topic?  Why is the candidate doing the bidding of this IP editor in an uncritical way?  My impression is that the candidate is too eager-to-please and naive to be given more power over such topics.

#'''Oppose''' <s>although weakly</s>. Having worked with Cyberpower for around one and half years now, I've slowly developed the opinion that while he means well, he is perhaps too enthusiastic or 'too helpful' meant in a bad way. In the past, I had mentored Cyber for privacy violations/account compromise which he did learn from but in the words of others above (along with the oversight block which I just learned about), it does bring up red flags. I do trust Cyber but I don't trust them that much for a role of elevated permissions '''yet'''. The focus of his work on bots and tools also seems to take up a majority of his time and I feel he is stacking up too many responsibilities to be good. I've noticed him say before on IRC that he does not have much free time to dedicate to some projects with xTools so I don't feel he has enough time to dedicate to enwiki sysop-ship either.

This is the kind of bad edit that many editors make every day, but we expect more from prospective admins responding to edit requests. I'm ok with supporting someone who isn't a content creator, but only with other evidence of proficiency in core content policies. That positive evidence just ain't here in this case; and the adverse edit-request evidence raises problems. Just in the last 12 months I see little content work, or even ancillary or related work (AfD, BLP, etc, per Collect above), other than low-range vandalism patrolling on Pokemon articles. Also telling for me is the lack of evidence in the three nominations and the support column. We have vague promises from nominators and supporters of the candidate's personal characteristics - leadership, commitment, humility, the works. But competence in core policy matters?

His real–life obligations, lack of content work, lack of AFD experience, and his answer to question 11 (in general admins must be familiar with the content and the policies that revolve around content creation) give me pause. I also believe that he needs to learn how to reflect on his actions before making them, rather than after the fact as mentioned in his responses above, so that issues will be less likely to arise in the future. -'''[[User:Pax85|<font color="darkgreen">Pax</font>]] [[User talk:Pax85|<font color=" ">Verbum</font>]]''' 06:59, 5 July 2015 (UTC)
#Per (but not only) [[Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive814#Cyberbot_II.2C_take_2]], I'm not sure about Cyberpower's maturity. If adminship were just about making bots and editing protected templates, etc., I wouldn't be too concerned. But with very little experience in article space behind them, I cannot sanction them closing complex AFDs and RfCs, protecting pages, threatening blocks, blocking, declining unblocks, etc. If Cyberpower were to promise not to do those latter things I would change my vote to support.

I am genuinely really sorry there isn't some way we can give them the technical tools they need (and clearly can be trusted with) without also having to give them people- and article-management tools (like blocking and deleting) while they have yet to demonstrate the necessary skills in those critical areas.

#::{{reply to|Anthonyhcole}} You're right that this RfA is on the margin and shows that some folks have concern.

#'''Oppose''': Too troubling a candidate and too many negatives not overridden by the supporting rationales. I also echo Softlavender's statement above and Kudpung's, in the neutral section below. Also, candidate's 'stress indicator' gives me great pause. {{xt|My stress indicator is quite serious. I feel it important users on Wikipedia know if I'm going through stress or not}}. This may be acceptable as just an editor, but as an editor I can walk away and watch DVD's for a day. My decisions and actions under stress only cause typos.  I am not reassured to know that I can monitor the stress of a admin, when stress can bring misjudgment and haste: This outburst: [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ACyberpower678&type=revision&diff=516865599&oldid=516848139%7C] was questioned above.

Sure, but we should be aware that it was three years ago and that, given his age, the level of maturity was entirely appropriate.

#'''Oppose''' - I don't doubt their sincerity. I'm more concerned about discernment, discretion, and judgement in general. While of course I am interested in their article-space edits, as this is rfa, I'm more interested in how they interact with others and how they put Wikipedia policies and process into '''''practice'''''.  (From my past experiences with this editor, I know they can ''"talk-the-talk"'' but over-exuberance at the very least (I'm trying to be kind here) they all too often do not ''"walk-the-walk"'' as it were, and (like the pending changes example they brought up) almost need to be harangued by other editors to follow community conventions. And from [[Wikipedia_talk:Pending_changes/Request_for_Comment_2013#Looking_for_closers|that discussion]] - '''''"When I voted in that RfC, I was merely curious on how it worked and wanted to see it in action."''''' Gives me chills on several grounds and not in a good way.)  And while I think edit counting is for the birds, I am concerned about the low level of activity in the lat 12 months. Especially when combined with others' concerns that the editor hasn't been updating/maintaining the tools they currently have been entrusted with. Use of any tool whatsoever requires community trust on some level. But let's set all that aside for the moment. '''What do they want with the extra tools and responsibilities of adminship?''' [[Wikipedia:Usernames for administrator attention]], edit templates, and maybe sometime in the future an adminbot and or other unnamed ideas for tools in the future?  Well, I don't doubt UAA could use another admin, like any other area on Wikipedia.  And you already have the '''templateeditor''' user-right. So I'll look at the rest: Adminbots are quite possibly one of the most controversial things on Wikipedia.  And tools and bot "ideas" aren't something that meets any criteria for adminship.  The last couple BRFAs I've seen, things were laid out very clearly on what are the purposes, limitations, access, etc of the bot. If you want us to grant you adminship merely for tool use, come to the community with more than a '''vague wave''', and show that you're currently active in '''maintaining''' the tools you've already been entrusted with. '''And finally''' - In my estimation the candidate just doesn't meet '''[[User:Jc37/RfA/Criteria|my criteria]]'''. And a want to help out at UAA isn't enough of a balance.

#::Thank you for bringing the text of that essay to my attention. I seem to remember that when we were discussing NOTNOW (prior to the creation of that essay), it was used more broadly. But regardless, I think the meaning was conveyed. (I've now delinked from that essay.)
#::As for knowing ''"...what adminship is all about"'', I will respectfully disagree. His IAR response alone shows the common misperception of what IAR means. In phrasing that question, I even try to help out the candidate with the helpful links. We, all of us, IAR nearly every time we edit. CON and BOLD are direct opposites and that is intentional.  The "[[nous]]" looked for is understanding that, and discerning how editing falls between both.

#'''Oppose''' While fully recognising the valuable work CP does on bots and tools, as a potential ''admin'' there are queries over (a) outlook: per Q19. To my mind bots are there to do more quickly or efficiently something that is done already, or that the community has decided should be done.

#'''Weak oppose''' The work that the candidate has done in technical areas is to be applauded, but for me their lack of content work is enough of a problem to oppose.

Cyber has neither, as demonstrated with his talk elswhere of still insisting on ''rewriting'' tools rather than porting perfectly functional versions by other devs to en.Wiki, and taking even more bot tasks from other people.

#: A lot of editors are citing your neutral (now oppose) so I will comment here.  I don't understand this reasoning.  the editor is not bound to create tools and could quit tomorrow.  If he decided his interest moved to admin tools and bots or decided he wanted to contribute in an completely different admin area, this is option is available to all admins.  Admins can choose to stop creating content, move from RPP to AfD or ANI or even move back to content creation.  It seems to me that his contributions require organisation and priorities and he wears it on his sleave.  On the other hand, most admins are willy-nilly and all over the map.  Even arbcom flips hats and priorities like ADD kids on amphetamines.  In what way do you see any "sense of organisation and priorities" being demonstrated by admins that really only complain that they lack time and resources?  I see him in a current role where this quality is needed and on display being pigeon holed because no one will ever satisfy speed, quality and cost desires.  The biggest excuse admins use to avoid taking action is "no one is compelled to act" yet it appears that is being used against this editor to prevent him from moving to a different area.  I've seen engineers and programmers that get in a "he's too important to move out of his job and grow" and the result is always the same:  they quit and grow somewhere else.  If he wants to try making tools with the bit or even branch into a different area, let him go.  We'll get better tools and happier editors.  This type of opposition feels like punishment instead of empowerment.  If there is no fear that he is going to break something with the bit or abuse it, why not give it to him?

Unfortunately for Cyberpower678, it is this enthusiasm that keeps biting him in his arse - he maintains bots and tools, a good number of which are in broken or breaking states. He's currently undergoing a BRfA and Josve05a has had to write up details showing that the bot is making a mess - the kicker is Josve05a has stated what could go wrong and has recommended solutions, but they were not implemented. And just [[User_talk:Cyberpower678#Page_histories|last week]], the Germans offered their own clones of tools in response to the xtools problem, but Cyberpower678 insists on rewriting his own instead of just porting them.</p><p>There's no doubt Cyberpower678 is contributing great changes to the project, but having administrator bits is not a big deal. However, it is much harder to take away than to give these bits. Cyberpower678 has done good work up to now without these tools, and therefore there is no need for them at present. Perhaps later, if Cyberpower678 decides to either up his game on tool and bot writing or starts contributing to what are considered typical activities wanted from potential administrator candidates. He's done a great job of nabbing tools that need maintainers, and I hope that as a new member of the xtools team I can provide what I know to make sure xtools is back up.</p><p>TParis talks about Worm's adoption, but this was never finished. It appears to be that he's active in the village pump for the sake of defending his work as well as snapping up new projects. The fact that these old bots need to be maintained does not make him a superb candidate for writing admin bots - on the contrary, it's a bad idea to give such an expansive toolset to a bot writer who may cause wreckage and havoc on his first try. I agree with Kudpung and say that he doesn't, and I quote TParis: "...recognize when it's appropriate to back out of a situation that is overwhelming..."</p><p>There are many supports here in this RfA raising praise to his technical aptitude. Cyberpower678 has written many bots, some of which break, which is a sign that 1. he's biting off more than he can chew, 2. he doesn't need admin bits to write bots, and 3. if he starts handling admin tasks, who will be maintaining his bots? While breakage is a part of the process that is software engineering, the amount of breakage that occurs is definitely above average. There is no need for adminbots that will cause major problems for the project.</p><p>There's no need to grant the mop to Cyberpower678 for his abilities elsewhere - he says it himself: "I'll admit, my content work isn't going to impress...". He also says "...I have no objections to not being an administrator...". The person in the spotlight has said it themself - there's no need to be an administrator.

#'''Oppose''', per the reasoning offered by both [[User:Kudpung|Kudpung]] and [[User:SigmaWP|Sigma]].

That being said, I don't wish to undermine their technical contributions or (obvious) intrinsic value to the project. I'd be happy to support them, if and when the time comes, if they accumulate more experience in the relevant areas, and set their mind to becoming a more well-rounded editor. I sincerely hope you take both mine and the other oppose votes as helpful constructive criticism, and additional motivation to do just that.

# When this RfA started, I decided that I was not going to participate as I was on the fence regarding whether to support or oppose. I know Cyber very well over at [[WP:ACC|ACC]], where I have worked with him for a long while now, and it is because I know him so well that I felt it was important that I voice my opinion. Cyberpower is a kind and helpful Wikipedian and I have no doubt he does positively contribute to Wikipedia in many ways; that being said, what prevented me from a beat-the-nom-support was a part of me that lacked full confidence to support. After much consideration and time, I decided to support Cyber in the RfA, but as I continued to think about it, I felt a little bit uncomfortable in my choice. I know Cyber is a busy person, and between his technical work and ACC work, I am concerned he will be biting off more than he can chew at this time; if that happens, I am afraid Cyber may get too stressed to accurately and appropriately execute his duties as an administrator. In addition, Cyber has the potential to be hasty in his actions and/or not as thorough in his decision making, as shown in a [https://accounts.wmflabs.org/statistics.php?page=Users&user=850 one day suspension] at ACC in January of 2015 for "recent errors and issues handling requests." At the time of his suspension, Cyber also requested an additional 14 day suspension as a forced break from ACC. I question if he is able to handle stressful situations with self-control rather than by technical enforcement; we can't block and desysop an admin every time a stressful situation, conflict, or concern arises. Cyberpower, you are a great person and I consider you a friend. I hope you do not take this personally and I would like you to know that I will likely support an RfA in the future, but for now I must '''oppose'''.

#'''Oppose''', regretfully. Cyberpower the editor is a net asset, no doubt (I am not able to weigh this xtools stuff--like many others I notice that stuff if broken all the damn time, but I have no idea if that's his fault or not, so that's not what I'm basing this on), but being an admin requires a set of extra skills and some knowledge of policies and guidelines, a knowledge that should be gained, in my opinion, through experience and interaction. That's missing, and so I cannot support. Sorry Cyberpower. [[User:Drmies|Drmies]] ([[User talk:Drmies|talk]]) 01:31, 10 July 2015 (UTC)

::<s>'''Neutral''', for now, until I can review Cyberpower's history. I'm somewhat unimpressed by his mainspace work (most of which seems to be on Pokemon articles). I would generally like to see at least 25% mainspace contributions, but I might be willing to make an exception for such a specialized editor upon whose bots we rely upon. --[[User:Biblioworm|<span style="color:#6F4E37;">'''''Biblio'''''</span>]][[User_talk:Biblioworm|<span style="color:#6F4E37;">'''''worm'''''</span>]] 01:18, 3 July 2015 (UTC)</s>

::{{ec}} <s>'''Neutral'''</s> Moving to 'Oppose". If you were anyone else, this would probably be a clear 'Support'. I hate to do this Cyberpower, but you are so snarled up with all your bots and the work you have undertaken for the migration of important tools from the ToolServer to Labs and still nothing functioning at all as it should after all this time, plus the loss of your 'team' through retirement and being banned by Arbcom, and your admission that your newly begun tertiary studies leave you hard pressed for time, that I cannot see you having time at all for admin tasks (not to mention this RfA) on top of all that. As any admin knows, after passing RfA the temptationion to start using the tools is immense - even for a person of my advanced years who is not in the slightest bit interested in accumulating 'toys'. I would wholeheartedly support an application from you for the mop as soon as the issues with the Labs tools have finally been addressed once and for all, but for now, adminship is too soon. Sorry, but you can of course count on my continued support for getting those issued sorted as quickly as possible. --[[User:Kudpung|Kudpung กุดผึ้ง]] ([[User talk:Kudpung|talk]]) 01:26, 3 July 2015 (UTC)
::<s>'''Preliminary neutral''' With all the bots/tools my baseline criterium "Is dedicated to the project" is satisfied, but the lack of content contributions is regrettable. Nothing here or on their talkpage to suggest that cyberpower would end up POV-pushing or engage in any serious misbehaviour. The admittedly large number of issues with the tools that I see on their talkpage appear to get addressed in a speedy and professional fashion. An oversight block is obviously a serious issue but a successful BASC appeal (BASC does have a reputation for being extremely strict) as well as the conversations [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Cyberpower678/Archive_1#Unblock_Request here and forward] and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Cyberpower678/Archive_2#RFA_2 here] indicate to me that the issues are addressed (Also, the block was several years ago and happened only a few months into their editorship). Participation on on-wiki admin venues is a bit low, though, hampering my assessment of their ability to handle these adminship chores. Also, Q12 is potentially an issue given the importance of impartiality in administrator actions. Filing this as "preliminary" because not all questions are answered yet and some of these are important for me to gauge.[[User:Jo-Jo Eumerus|Jo-Jo Eumerus]] ([[User talk:Jo-Jo Eumerus|talk]]) 12:03, 3 July 2015 (UTC)</s> Moving to '''Support''' per the answers provided.

#'''Neutral''' I looked at the contribution history.  There is not enough in that area for me to support.  There is a reason why admins will ideally have a strong record of encyclopedic content creation here.  It makes them look good, and the admin corps has to look good.  First and foremost, the admin corps needs to look like it understands editors.  Admins should be able to advise on editing and coping with editorial conflict, from an editor's perspective.  The admins here as a whole must strive not to be stereotyped as clueless, tendentious people with ban-hammers who impose their august positions on the writers here.  Considering the strong support so far, I can only suggest that Cyberpower work on some articles and then seek renomination.

#:<s>I am very torn about this. On the one hand, this appears to be a very valuable contributor, doing great work on tools that we all use (and I really don't understand the griping about having to wait for things to be done, we're all volunteers here, aren't we?) However, when I look at the CSD log, it is basically empty (mostly some maintenance-related CCDs) and AfD participation is very low (for an admin candidate). There are 19 NAC closures, one of which went to [[Wikipedia:Deletion review/Log/2012 September 5#Legionwood%3A Tale of the Two Swords|DRV]], where the candidate was admonished that their NAC closure had been inappropriate and which has a strange offer by the candidate to "step down from my position" if found to having been wrong (what position would that be?), but all of that is pretty old stuff, too. I went through the contribution history of the [[List of Pokémon: Black & White episodes|article that received most of the candidate's edits]] and don't see any referencing. Indeed, the article as a whole, despite more than 100 edits by the candidate, is not well-referenced (several refs were bare links to amazon.com; I just used the Reflinks tool to at least correct that). Granted, most list articles are sourced only sparsely and these edits were a while ago, but going through the candidate's more recent edit history, I didn't really see much content work, so this is all I could go by. I'll be interested to see the answer to Q25. --[[User:Randykitty|Randykitty]] ([[User talk:Randykitty|talk]]) 11:20, 5 July 2015 (UTC)</s> Moved to "oppose". --[[User:Randykitty|Randykitty]] ([[User talk:Randykitty|talk]]) 08:06, 9 July 2015 (UTC)
