===[[Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Ealdgyth|Ealdgyth]]===
'''Final: (250/0/2) - Closed as successful by [[User:Acalamari|Acalamari]] at 14:00, 10 January 2017 (UTC)'''

====Nomination====
{{User|Ealdgyth}}&nbsp;– Now, some people think just because I wrote [[User:Ritchie333/Why admins should create content|this]], I know something about writing articles around here. Well, compared to Ealdgyth I know nothing - this editor has a phenomenal track record with over 50 [[WP:FA|featured articles]] and 100 [[WP:GA|good articles]] including getting such heavyweights as the [[Battle of Hastings]], [[William the Conqueror]] and <small>(gasp!)</small> the [[Middle Ages]] to FA; something I am truly in awe at. So when she decided it might be a nice idea to have the admin tools, I, like several others, leapt at the chance to nominate.

Now, I think I should be honest and say that Ealdgyth is not the sort of "career admin" who is drawn to the maintenance areas of the project, but her [https://tools.wmflabs.org/afdstats/afdstats.py?name=Ealdgyth&max=500&startdate= AfD stats], showing 95% correct out over 100 discussions, convince me she is not going to cause any harm with the tools, and she is always willing to lend a hand where possible. In particular, I think she would be a good fit for working at [[WP:ERRORS]], where we need more admins with a good understanding of content and sourcing, and can fix a wide variety of articles with the minimum of fuss.

I just showed my other half the list of accomplishments and her response was, "she shouldn't have to ''request'' adminship - it should simply be given to her!" I hope there's an unanimous agreement that's the case. [[User:Ritchie333|<b style="color:#7F007F">Ritchie333</b>]] [[User talk:Ritchie333|<sup style="color:#7F007F">(talk)</sup>]] [[Special:Contributions/Ritchie333|<sup style="color:#7F007F">(cont)</sup>]] 19:33, 22 December 2016 (UTC)

'''Co-nomination'''
I've known and worked with Ealdgyth for many years on Wikipedia. She is knowledgable, helpful and humorous. Her work in pushing articles through the Featured Article process shows many excellent qualities for adminiship - striving for excellence, collegiate working, persuading people, dealing with less knowledgable people who 'know' they are right, dealing with [[WP:OWN]] and a whole heap of other useful stuff.

To those who may wish to accuse her of liking to collect shiny things, with her impressive set of FAs and GAs, note this. She is very unselfish. In addition to pushing through her "own" quality materials, Ealdgyth is willing and able to give copyediting time and dedicated attention to those of others. Over the years, she's weighed in at [[WP:PR]] and [[WP:FAC]] on a number of articles I've been involved with, on a range of topics she mostly knows little about - and cares even less, spotting mangled English, misplaced punctuation and missing citations as keenly on [[cricket]] articles as in her own beloved medieval history genre (eg [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AFeatured_article_candidates%2FHistory_of_Norwich_City_F.C.&type=revision&diff=203985789&oldid=203965828 here]). (Thanks again, Ealdgyth). 

I think the one Achilles heel Ealdgyth may have here is the thorny old issue of 'need for the tools'. I'd say a few things in response. First, she has expressed interest in helping at ERRORS, where we are desperate for more admins since the most active administrator there is no longer able to help. She'll be a massive asset, as Main page quality issues are a constant problem, with difficulties over nuance of language etc. Second, I have no doubt that as she eases into the toolset she will, as we all do as admins, find areas that interest her that she can bring her mindset and experience to grips with. What you're !voting on is her aptitude for the tasks she'll face, not whether she already has demonstrable experience in every aspect of the various tools.

We are desperately short of even-tempered, knowledgable, experienced Wikipedians who give their time unselfishly ... and have the tools. I implore the community to give the toolset to this excellent candidate. --[[User:Dweller|Dweller]] ([[User talk:Dweller|talk]]) <small>Become [[User:Dweller/Old Fashioned Wikipedian Values|old fashioned!]]</small> 09:53, 23 December 2016 (UTC)

'''Co-nomination''' I'd also like to sponsor the nomination.  I don't want to repeat everything that's been said above, though I agree with it.  In addition to taking on big, amorphous articles that are the hardest to write and get to FA, Ealdgyth has been a voice of reason in the often contentious disputes we have had at [[WT:FAC]], and her effectiveness in that is shown by the fact that she is one of the few people there that everyone is on speaking terms with. :) 

I am not greatly concerned with need for the bits.  Our purpose here, though we contribute in many ways, is to put high quality content before the public.   We are not short of mops. It is quite sufficient if she uses the bits to expedite her own work, as I do, and as other admins do who are principally content contributors.  Anything she cares to do beyond that is  bonus. 

I understand that others wish to co-nom as well, so I'll shut up and get out of the way, but not before saying that in my view there are very few people, if any, more qualified to have the bits than Ealdgyth.--[[User:Wehwalt|Wehwalt]] ([[User talk:Wehwalt|talk]]) 15:00, 23 December 2016 (UTC)
:''Candidate, please indicate acceptance of the nomination here:'' I accept this nomination, although I'm blushing quite a bit from the praise above, which I don't honestly feel is quite deserved. [[User:Ealdgyth|Ealdgyth]] - [[User talk:Ealdgyth|Talk]] 14:07, 3 January 2017 (UTC)

====Questions for the candidate====
Dear candidate, thank you for offering to serve Wikipedia as an administrator. Please answer these questions to provide guidance for participants:
:'''1.''' What administrative work do you intend to take part in?
::'''A:''' The main areas I would see myself regularly participating in would be [[WP:ERRORS]], once I figure out how to safely edit things on the main page. I would also try to help out some with [[WP:DYK]], but probably not to a great extent. I am unlikely to become involved in blocking many editors, as I'm really not into that sort of behavior. I could see some work at [[WP:RPP]], if things got backlogged. I'd also try to weigh in a bit more with my opinion on the various noticeboards where admin input is sought. As far as my own editing, I would find the ability to move articles over redirects to be useful as well as occasionally seeing deleted articles that might need recreating. 

:'''2.''' What are your best contributions to Wikipedia, and why?
::'''A:''' I enjoy working on historical topics - especially medieval and equine topics.  Personally, I'm most proud of the obscure topics I've brought up to snuff - such as [[Jersey Act]] or [[Monroe Edwards]]. For a while, I seemed to specialize in "bad boy" bishops - such as [[William Longchamp]], [[Stigand]], or [[Geoffrey (archbishop of York)]]. I do recognize, however, that many folks are more impressed with the "big topics", and I do know we need more work on topics such as [[Middle Ages]] or [[Norman conquest of England]]. I am proud that I've slowly been working on bringing up the coverage of medieval English ecclesiastics to a higher standard. I've branched out somewhat lately, due to being in a (very lengthy) process of moving, and haven't been doing as much content work as much of my library is being packed up. This is one reason why I was willing to consider becoming an admin - the desire to contribute while unable to do the in-depth research I'm used to (at least until the move is finished).

:'''3.''' Have you been in any conflicts over editing in the past or have other users caused you stress? How have you dealt with it and how will you deal with it in the future?
::'''A:''' The biggest conflicts have taken place on the "big articles" - [[William the Conqueror]], [[Middle Ages]], [[Norman conquest of England]], and [[Battle of Hastings]]. One conflict is the "anti-Bulgarian bias" problem that's documented in the archives of [[Middle Ages]]. Some of it's at [[Talk:Middle Ages/Archive 8]] and [[Talk:Middle Ages/Archive 7]] which spilled into [[Wikipedia:Sockpuppet investigations/Sumatro/Archive]]. The lead image at Middle Ages has also attracted controversy which is documented at [[Talk:Middle Ages/Archive 6]] and [[Talk:Middle Ages/Archive 5]]. The Bulgarian issue was definitely a POV pusher (who turned out to be a sockpuppet), and the best way to handle those is to remain calm and attempt to reason. That particular disupte did, however, teach me that I'm not well suited to hunting out sockpuppets - I just miss them entirely. You can be assured I will not be involving myself in [[WP:SPI]]! In the image issue, I got a bit testier than I'd probably like to get, but there are times when wall-of-texts just get to me, and my way of coping is to step back, get outside input on my own behavior, and try to ride out the storm.

::The issue with [[Norman conquest of England]] is documented at [[Talk:Battle of Hastings#September/October 2016]] was again a situation where just getting outside input and riding out the storm was the best solution. Sticking to the best sourcing possible, being willing (within reason) to listen to the other side, and avoiding edit warring are the best solutions to these sorts of disputes. I will admit that having that dispute blow up and ruin Hastings' chance at being on the main page for its 950th anniversary did make me a bit crankier than I like to be. 

::There's also the run in with this sockpuppeter: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive923#Archbishop_Booth here]. This one was easier to deal with, but again, I totally missed the sockpuppeting. Oops?

::As I'm sure most folks know, I've collaborated with {{u|Eric Corbett}} quite successfully in the past. I generally avoid commenting much on his language or behavior, but I did get a bit testy [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive817#Incivility_and_personal_attacks_by_User:Eric_Corbett here], which wasn't my finest hour, I'll admit. I know that I'm much too involved to ever possibly block/unblock/take any admin action on EC, and am also quite clear that I need to avoid doing administration actions on other people with whom I've worked closely on Wikipedia over the years. I do, however, reserve the right to comment on such situations at noticeboards or talk pages, while also noting my involvement.

:: Further to stress levels, one major source of (non-wiki) stress is no longer relevant in my life so my stress levels as far as editing are much less than they had been in the past few years. Besides the move, nothing else major is on my horizon - I am officially an empty-nester and no longer need to care for my elderly and ill mother, so life is much better than it had been the last few years.

;Additional questions from [[User:Biblioworm|Biblio]]
:'''4.''' What are your views on the observation of the [[WP:CIVIL]] and [[WP:NPA]] policies? Is it ever justifiable to [[WP:IAR|ignore]] them? 
::'''A:''' In general, they shouldn't be ignored. But, we also need to be aware that different areas of the world have differing standards of civility. I'm American and thus my normal standards of civility differ from English which differ from Australian which differ from Indian, etc. etc.  I generally try to avoid cussing in the wrong company, but I know that what I would consider a nasty cuss word that no one really ever utters is in other parts of the world something that isn't nearly so horrid. There is more to civility than just using cuss words or avoiding attacking people directly. Civility is a two way street also - you can avoid cuss words all you want but if you're constantly pushing other editor's buttons, you shouldn't be surprised to have someone cuss you out. In the end, we're here to make an encyclopedia. I'm much much more concerned about poor sourcing and POV pushing than I am about civility. My personal opinion is that being rude/incivil is counter-productive, but I understand that this isn't an opinion shared by most. I think blocking for civility is also counterproductive, but unless it's wildly inappropriate, I'm of the opinion that fighting about it is akin to Cnut fighting the tide - it's never really going to help matters to get up in arms about it. 
:: As far as NPA goes - one thing I've learned over my years of editing (something I learned at a summer camp I worked at, in fact) is to avoid "you" statements and concentrate on "I feel" statements when in a personality dispute. If you feel attacked - don't say "you're attacking me"... instead say "I feel attacked by <statement>." This approach doesn't always work perfectly, but it does help de-escalate the situation some. I see a lot of people throw around "That was a personal attack" when it's often a borderline case. I don't always manage to comment only on the edits, not the editor, but I do try. I try to cut other editors some slack even if I feel like they are attacking me, and would like to think most other editors would at least endeavor to do the same. 
:: In sum, I generally turn the other cheek (even though that's not really my religious imperative), and hope most other editors try to, but I also recognize that I'm a bit more laid back about the situation than most and am not likely to raise a stink about other admins enforcing other standards as long as they aren't wildly outside community norms. I reserve the right to perhaps discuss and make my opinion known, but blocking/unblocking isn't something I'm interested in. And I reiterate my complete understanding that there are a number of other editors with whom I should NEVER block/unblock because I've worked too closely with them over the years. If I'm ever in doubt about whether I'm involved with some other editor, I'll not take admin actions concerning that editor.
:: I also think some of the worst episodes of incivility/NPA occur because of internal wiki-politics. We all know that there are "backside" battles that happen, and those battles seem to be the occasion of some of the worst of the flare-ups of cussing/attacking/etc. I have no good answers on how to solve that problem - I suspect it's endemic in the human condition to be somewhat tribal and choose sides. The best we can do is try to remember that the "other side" is human too, and treat them as best we can.
:::'''Follow-up''': {{ping|Ealdgyth}} Hi again. I plan to support this RfA—I just haven't had time lately—but I have one last follow-up question (to clarify, follow-up questions are permitted). In your [[User:Ealdgyth/2015 Arb Election votes|2015 ACE voter's guide]], you said, "I do not consider myself suited for ArbCom, I do not deal well with high stress situations nor do I have the tact required." Adminship and ArbCom are, of course, quite different, but as an admins you may sometimes have to deal with high-stress situations, and according to policy admins are expected to calmly [[WP:ADMINACCT|explain their actions]]. 
:::Therefore, could you elaborate on how you will reconcile with your stress intolerance with your adminship? Thanks. [[User:Biblioworm|Biblio]]([[User_talk:Biblioworm#top|talk]])  22:33, 9 January 2017 (UTC)
:::: To be blunt, my elderly mother died a bit over two months ago. She had dementia and we were caring for her at home. She was unable to grasp the she was physically incapable of walking, and had to be monitored 24/7. That was a huge stress, and no longer applies. (I alluded to this at the end of my answer to question three.) We are moving, but that stress doesn't begin to compare to the stress of caring for an elderly dementia patient. (We've been doing that since 2011, pretty much.) I still consider myself unsuited for Arb Com, but since I don't have to involve myself in the really stressful areas of admining, I should be able to keep the stress levels bearable. (You can rest assured I'm not likely to start working in the Israel-Palestine area, for example.) ArbCom has no choice in being involved in high stress situations, admins have much more choice. One reason I am unlikely to block/unblock much is that is one way to avoid higher stress. [[User:Ealdgyth|Ealdgyth]] - [[User talk:Ealdgyth|Talk]] 23:57, 9 January 2017 (UTC)
:'''5.''' How should we treat new users who make mistakes when editing articles?
::'''A:''' It depends on what the mistake is. If it's taking the article on [[Sparta]] and replacing it with ''THIS IS SPARTAAA!!!!'' ... well, that sort of mistake just needs to follow the "do not feed the trolls" advice.
:: If the editor isn't doing obvious vandalism, but it is something minor - say adding in a reference to an article in the wrong format, or if they've put in an unreliable source - the best practice is to fix it and explain in an edit summary or similar. Explanations are best, although often it can be done in an edit summary. It's nice if the editor is really new if you put an welcome template on their talk page. 
:: If the editor persists in making the same or similar mistakes even after having it explained to them, well, then it's a bigger problem. It could be a POV problem or it could just be not understanding the explanation. When I run into these situations, I generally try to get a second opinion on my own behavior to see what *I* can do to improve things. 
:: I'm not perfect - I will freely admit that I don't go around checking on how long other editors have been around or seeing if the person who just made a mess out of an article is a newbie or has been around a while. I try to adhere to the best practices, but I know I've probably fallen down on the job in the past - it's hard to remain ultra-polite when you've got someone inserting nonsense or mucking about with an article with an established style. I have a belief that as long as the other editor is trying to learn the ropes, I'll try to help, but if they keep making the same mistakes (or, worse, don't bother to read the relavant help pages before leaping into editing...), at some point competence has to come into the picture.

#'''Support'''. Whether she would make prolific use of the tools is not really the issue. We don't have a limit on the number of administrators so it's not as if Ealdgyth would be occupying a spot that could be taken by a more prolific admin. What is at issue is that we trust her judgement, so we know that when she ''does'' use the tools, it will be for the good of Wikipedia. I have no concerns about Ealdgyth's judgement, and writing so many featured articles will certainly have honed all the skills and experience an admin needs to do their duty. I share Ritchie's awe at Ealdgyth's 50 featured articles; as someone whose tenth is just working its way through FAC, I can very well imagine the challenge of writing about a sprawling subject like the Middle Ages.

#'''Support''' - I don't recall ever seeing a better candidate for the tools. The "need" for tools isn't particularly strong but occassional work at WP:ERRORS and WP:DYK is fine for such a stellar candidate. 56 FAs? that's genuinely an amazing contribution to the encyclopaedia. Definitenly support this candidate. Though, {{u|Ealdgyth}}, I'd point to Gwyneth as a "th" ending name that is obviously feminine, though I didn't know about the vowels thing. Makes me think of the Roman era; Julia vs Julius, Claudia vs Claudius, Antonia vs Antonius. Many "ius" names for men and "ia" names for women. Though a rare example of a male name ending in a vowel would be the nicknames of emperors Caligula (little boots) and Caracalla (a gallic cloak). The Greeks were not so dissimilar with womens names ending in vowels like [[Hypatia]] and male names ending in "vowel s" such as Seleucus and Hippocrates.

She has a low level of participation at anything in the "Wikipedia" namespace as of recently (her last surge of participation in that namespace was in January of 2015).  In terms of her activity level, it seems rather sporadic with less than 500 edits per month since May of 2016.

:: My perspective: When I was nominated at RFA in 2009 I thought I would work on [[WP:CP]] and [[WP:NFCR]] (which doesn't even exist any more) and didn't end up doing much of either. I knew the tools would be useful and took my best guess at where I'd end up helping. My point is that many admin candidates can't know where they will use the tools until they get more experience; I bet if you did an audit of where candidates said they'd use the tools and where they actually did, you'd find a lot of disparity.

#'''Neutral''': {{em|Generally}} seems like a net positive, but has supported [[WP:SSF]] arguments against our style guidelines.  An editor who thinks guidelines or other site-wide consensus should be ignored for the sake of writing like specialist sources would for specialists, instead of writing like an encyclopedia should for a general audience, could cause a lot of drama as an admin.  It's a bit like being a cop who decides that federal and municipal law applies, but to hell with state or county law; or being kind to dogs, except long-haired ones; or insert some other analogy here. Either someone is on board with how [[WP:POLICY]] functions and why, or they are not. That said, the editor seems smart and committed to the project; I can just hope for clear separation of admin activities from [[WP:INVOLVED]] topical areas like whether our guideline on something says what the candidate wants it to. <span style="white-space:nowrap;font-family:'Trebuchet MS'"> — [[User:SMcCandlish|'''SMcCandlish''' ☺]] [[User talk:SMcCandlish|☏]] [[Special:Contributions/SMcCandlish|¢]] ≽<sup>ʌ</sup>ⱷ҅<sub>ᴥ</sub>ⱷ<sup>ʌ</sup>≼ </span> 11:29, 10 January 2017 (UTC)
